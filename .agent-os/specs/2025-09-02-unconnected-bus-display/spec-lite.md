# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enhance the routing editor to visually indicate ports assigned to buses without matching connections, displaying short connection lines with bus labels (o----[A1] or [A3]---o) as warnings to help users identify potentially incomplete signal routing. The system intelligently handles zero-value ports as unconnected without visual representation, providing clear feedback without treating unconnected buses as errors.
