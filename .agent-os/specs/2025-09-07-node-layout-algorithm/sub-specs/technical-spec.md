# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-node-layout-algorithm/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Layout Algorithm**: Implement a layered/hierarchical layout algorithm that positions nodes in vertical layers (inputs → algorithms → outputs) with optimized Y positioning to minimize connection crossings
- **Algorithm Integration**: Add layout functionality to the existing RoutingEditorCubit state management without disrupting current routing logic
- **Button UI Component**: Create a layout algorithm action button using Material Design principles, positioned adjacent to the refresh routing button with appropriate spacing and styling
- **Node Positioning System**: Implement coordinate calculation logic that considers node dimensions, connection paths, and maintains minimum spacing requirements (30px buffer zones)
- **Connection Analysis**: Develop connection overlap detection and scoring system to evaluate layout quality and guide optimization decisions
- **State Preservation**: Ensure layout changes integrate with existing routing editor state management and don't interfere with live MIDI synchronization
- **Animation Support**: Add smooth transition animations for node repositioning using Flutter's built-in animation framework
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensure layout algorithm adapts to different screen sizes and routing editor viewport dimensions
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient algorithm execution for typical node counts (up to 50 nodes) with sub-second calculation times
- **Integration Points**: Hook into existing RoutingEditorWidget visualization layer and RoutingEditorCubit state management without breaking current architecture patterns
