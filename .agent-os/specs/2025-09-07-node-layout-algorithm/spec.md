> Spec: Node Layout Algorithm
> Created: 2025-09-07

## Overview

Implement an intelligent node layout algorithm for the routing editor that automatically optimizes node positioning to minimize connection overlap while maintaining logical slot ordering. This feature will enhance the visual clarity of complex routing configurations and provide users with a one-click solution to organize cluttered routing diagrams.

## User Stories

### Routing Visualization Optimization

As a Eurorack musician working with complex routing configurations, I want to click a layout algorithm button to automatically organize my routing nodes, so that I can quickly understand and analyze complex signal paths without manually repositioning nodes.

When I have a routing diagram with overlapping connections and scattered nodes, I can click the layout algorithm button next to the refresh routing button. The algorithm will reposition all nodes to minimize connection crossings while keeping lower-numbered slots positioned higher on the Y-axis. Physical input and output nodes will be centered vertically on the left and right sides respectively, with algorithm nodes optimally positioned between them. This provides a clean, readable routing diagram that maintains logical flow and reduces visual confusion.

## Spec Scope

1. **Layout Algorithm Implementation** - Create an intelligent positioning algorithm that reduces connection overlap and maintains slot ordering principles.
2. **UI Integration** - Add a layout algorithm action button positioned beside the existing refresh routing button in the routing editor.
3. **Node Positioning Logic** - Implement smart positioning for physical inputs (left), outputs (right), and algorithm nodes (center) with appropriate spacing.
4. **Connection Optimization** - Prioritize connection clarity over strict slot ordering when positioning conflicts arise.
5. **User Interface Feedback** - Provide visual feedback during layout calculation and smooth transitions for node repositioning.

## Out of Scope

- Manual node dragging and positioning (existing functionality remains unchanged)
- Custom layout algorithm preferences or configuration options
- Undo functionality for layout changes (handled by existing routing editor state management)
- Layout algorithm performance optimization for extremely large node counts (focus on typical use cases)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional layout algorithm button integrated into the routing editor that successfully reduces connection overlap in typical routing scenarios.
2. Proper slot ordering maintenance where lower-numbered slots appear higher (lower Y values) when connection clarity allows.
3. Correctly positioned physical input and output nodes with centered vertical alignment and appropriate spacing from algorithm nodes.
