> Spec: Connection Labels for Routing Visualization
> Created: 2025-09-01

## Overview

Add informative labels to routing connections that display the bus identifier used for signal routing. This enhancement improves routing clarity by showing users exactly which bus carries each connection's signal in a concise, standardized format.

## User Stories

### Visual Bus Identification

As a user managing complex routing configurations, I want to see bus labels on each connection, so that I can quickly identify which bus carries each signal without examining parameter details.

Users working with the routing editor need to understand signal flow at a glance. When connections are displayed between hardware inputs, outputs, and algorithms, each connection line should show a small label indicating the bus number in use. This allows users to verify routing correctness, identify potential conflicts, and understand the signal path through the system.

## Spec Scope

1. **Bus Label Rendering** - Display text labels centered on connection lines showing bus identifiers
2. **Bus Type Formatting** - Format labels as I# for inputs (1-12), O# for outputs (1-8), A# for aux buses (1-8)
3. **Label Positioning** - Calculate and maintain center position of labels on curved connection paths
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Ensure labels are readable but don't dominate the routing visualization

## Out of Scope

- Interactive label editing or customization
- Connection tooltips or detailed information popups
- Bus allocation management or reassignment
- Label collision detection or automatic repositioning

## Expected Deliverable

1. Connection labels visible on all routing connections showing the appropriate bus identifier
2. Labels correctly formatted based on bus type (I#, O#, or A# format)
3. Labels positioned at the visual center of each connection path
