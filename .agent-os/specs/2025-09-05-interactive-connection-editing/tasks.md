  - [ ] 2.2 Implement bidirectional drag detection (output-to-input and input-to-output)
  - [ ] 2.3 Add drag preview line rendering with coordinate transforms
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement valid drop zone detection with visual highlighting
  - [ ] 2.5 Integrate drag completion with optimistic connection creation
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all drag-and-drop functionality tests pass

- [ ] 3. Create connection deletion with gesture support
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for connection deletion gestures (double-click, hover+click, tap+confirm)

  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for port mode toggle functionality and visual indicators
  - [ ] 4.2 Add single-tap gesture detection on output port labels
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement mode parameter updates in cubit with hardware sync
  - [ ] 4.4 Add visual mode indicators (blue styling, "(R)" suffix for Replace mode)
  - [ ] 4.5 Create smooth mode transition animations
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all mode toggle functionality tests pass

- [ ] 5. Build automatic bus assignment and connection validation
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for ConnectionBusManager and InteractiveConnectionValidator services
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement intelligent bus assignment (physical ports 1-20, aux buses 21-28)
  - [ ] 5.3 Add real-time connection validation during drag operations  
  - [ ] 5.4 Build conflict detection and resolution for bus assignments
  - [ ] 5.5 Integrate validation feedback with visual drag previews
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify all bus assignment and validation tests pass

- [ ] 6. Integrate all features into routing editor widget
  - [ ] 6.1 Write integration tests for complete interactive connection editing workflow
  - [ ] 6.2 Integrate drag-and-drop, deletion, and mode toggle into routing canvas
  - [ ] 6.3 Add connection sync notification system with user feedback
  - [ ] 6.4 Coordinate all gesture recognition with existing pan/zoom functionality
  - [ ] 6.5 Test cross-platform compatibility (mouse and touch interactions)
  - [ ] 6.6 Verify all integration tests pass and full workflow functions correctly
