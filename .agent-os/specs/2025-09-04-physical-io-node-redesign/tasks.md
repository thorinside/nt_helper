# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-04-physical-io-node-redesign/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-04
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Universal Port Widget and Node Redesign

**Goal:** Create universal port_widget and redesign all routing nodes (algorithm and physical I/O) to use consistent port visualization.

1.1 Write detailed widget tests for new port_widget and all redesigned node types (algorithm and physical I/O)
1.2 Create universal port_widget with 24px circular port, configurable left/right label positioning, and global coordinate reporting
1.3 Refactor PhysicalInputNode to use port_widget with left-label positioning (I1-I12 format)
1.4 Refactor PhysicalOutputNode to use port_widget with right-label positioning (O1-O8 format)
1.5 Refactor AlgorithmNodeWidget to use port_widget for all input/output ports
1.6 Implement 24px vertical spacing using configurable constants and vertical spacers across all node types
1.7 Apply consistent Material Design styling and ensure connection anchoring targets port centers
1.8 Maintain stable port IDs (hw_in_X/hw_out_X for physical, existing format for algorithm ports)
1.9 Update widget documentation and code comments to reflect universal port_widget architecture
1.10 Verify all widget tests pass and connection line anchoring works correctly across all node types

### 2. Code Cleanup and Legacy Widget Removal

**Goal:** Remove unused and obsolete widget components while maintaining system stability and ensuring no breaking changes.

2.1 Write integration tests to verify routing functionality remains intact during cleanup process
2.2 Identify and document all unused widget components, existing algorithm port rendering code, and old connection gesture handlers
2.3 Remove JackConnectionWidget, existing algorithm port rendering code, old connection gesture code, and their associated test files
2.4 Clean up import statements and dependencies that referenced removed widgets and gesture handlers
2.5 Update any factory methods or widget creation logic to remove references to deleted components and old gesture handling
2.6 Review and update routing editor configuration to ensure no broken references remain
2.7 Run comprehensive code analysis to identify any remaining dead code or unused imports
2.8 Verify all integration tests pass and no functionality has been broken by cleanup

### 3. Integration Testing and System Validation

**Goal:** Ensure the redesigned physical I/O nodes integrate properly with the existing routing system and maintain all expected functionality.

3.1 Write end-to-end tests covering complete routing workflows with redesigned physical I/O nodes
3.2 Test connection discovery and visualization with new node designs across different algorithm configurations
3.3 Validate that node positioning and whole-node dragging work correctly (verify connection gestures are properly removed)
3.4 Test routing editor performance with multiple physical I/O nodes using new design implementation
3.5 Verify visual consistency across different device types (desktop, mobile, tablet) and screen densities
3.6 Test accessibility features and ensure screen reader compatibility meets standards
3.7 Conduct visual testing to validate algorithm node design consistency and improved clarity of redesigned nodes
3.8 Verify all tests pass, flutter analyze reports zero issues, and system performance meets requirements
