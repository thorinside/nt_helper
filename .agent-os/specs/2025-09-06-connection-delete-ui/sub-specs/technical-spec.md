# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-connection-delete-ui/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- Implement MouseRegion widgets around port visualization components with appropriate hit test behavior
- Add fade-in animations for delete icons using AnimatedOpacity or similar Flutter animation widgets
- Create platform detection logic to differentiate desktop hover vs mobile tap behaviors
- Integrate GestureDetector for mobile tap recognition on port components
- Implement confirmation dialog using Flutter's showDialog with Material Design components
- Use existing DistingCubit.updateParameterValue() method for smart bus assignment changes: set both algorithm ports to 0 for algorithm-to-algorithm connections, or only the algorithm port to 0 for physical IO connections (minimum allowed value for properties with minimum > 0)
- Route optimistic updates through RoutingEditorCubit to maintain architectural patterns
- Ensure mouse regions are sized appropriately (minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility)
- Implement proper cleanup of hover states and animations when ports become disconnected
- Add visual state management for delete icon visibility based on connection status and platform
- Use existing Port model bus assignment properties to determine connection status
- Leverage ConnectionDiscoveryService patterns to trigger UI updates when connections change

## Development Prerequisites

- Flutter application must be running during development to enable Dart MCP server functionality
- Dart MCP server provides validation, hot reloads, and development tooling integration
- If Flutter app is not running, development workflow will be limited and user should start the application
