> Spec: Connection Delete UI
> Created: 2025-09-06

## Overview

Implement intuitive connection deletion functionality in the routing editor with platform-specific interactions - hover-based deletion on desktop and tap-based dialog on mobile. This feature enhances the visual routing experience by providing users with quick, direct control over connection management while maintaining the app's existing optimistic update patterns.

## User Stories

### Desktop Power User Connection Management

As a desktop user, I want to hover over a connected port and see a delete icon appear, so that I can quickly remove unwanted connections without additional confirmations or dialog interruptions.

When I hover over any connected port, a small red circle with an X icon should fade in over the port. Clicking this icon immediately deletes the connection by setting the appropriate port bus assignments to 0 (both algorithm ports for algorithm-to-algorithm connections, or only the algorithm port for physical IO connections) through optimistic property updates, providing instant visual feedback without requiring confirmation dialogs.

### Mobile Touch-based Connection Management

As a mobile user, I want to tap on a connected port and get a clear deletion option, so that I can manage connections effectively on touch devices where hover interactions are not available.

When I tap any connected port, if that port has an active connection, a dialog appears asking if I want to delete the connection. The dialog provides clear "Cancel" and "Delete" options, with the delete action performing the same smart bus assignment updates as desktop.

## Spec Scope

1. **Desktop Hover Interactions** - Implement mouse region detection over ports with fade-in delete icons for connected ports
2. **Mobile Tap Interactions** - Add tap gesture recognition with confirmation dialog for connected ports
3. **Smart Bus Updates** - Integrate with existing DistingCubit optimistic property changes through RoutingEditorCubit to set appropriate ports to 0 (both algorithm ports for algorithm-to-algorithm connections, only algorithm port for physical IO connections)
4. **Visual Feedback** - Provide smooth animations for delete icon appearance and immediate connection removal
5. **Cross-platform Responsiveness** - Ensure mouse regions are appropriately sized for both desktop precision and mobile touch targets

## Out of Scope

- Bulk connection deletion or multi-select functionality
- Undo/redo functionality for deleted connections
- Connection deletion confirmation on desktop (mobile only)
- Alternative connection management methods beyond port-based deletion

## Expected Deliverable

1. Connected ports on desktop show hoverable delete icons that immediately remove connections when clicked
2. Connected ports on mobile show confirmation dialog when tapped, allowing connection deletion
3. All connection deletions use existing optimistic property update patterns and provide immediate visual feedback
