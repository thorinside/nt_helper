			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Create RoutingEditorWidget with Grid and Pan",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of RoutingEditorWidget into detailed subtasks covering: 1) Basic widget structure and state management, 2) Canvas setup with InteractiveViewer, 3) Grid background rendering, 4) Snap-to-grid logic, and 5) Theme integration and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a complex widget with multiple interactive features. The 5000x5000 canvas needs precise coordinate handling, the InteractiveViewer integration adds complexity for panning, and the grid background with snap-to-grid logic requires custom painting and mathematical calculations. The existing subtasks already cover the main components well."

			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Draggable AlgorithmNodeWidget",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of AlgorithmNodeWidget into detailed subtasks covering: 1) Custom drag logic with coordinate transforms, 2) Title bar and visual structure, 3) Toolbar with up/down/delete actions, 4) Input/output connection points, and 5) Visual state management for enabled/disabled actions.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex drag-and-drop functionality with precise coordinate transforms, which is technically challenging. It also requires implementing multiple interactive UI elements (title bar, toolbar with actions, connection points) and managing various visual states. The integration with InteractiveViewer adds another layer of complexity for coordinate mapping."

			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Build InputPanelWidget and OutputPanelWidget",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of InputPanelWidget and OutputPanelWidget into detailed subtasks covering: 1) Base widget structure for both panel types, 2) Draggable connection points implementation, 3) Coordinate transform system, 4) Visual styling and labeling, and 5) Connection state indicators and accessibility features.",
			"reasoning": "Creating two related but distinct widget types with draggable elements requires careful design. The coordinate transform system for precise mouse-to-canvas mapping adds significant complexity. The need for visual indicators, consistent styling, and accessibility features further increases the implementation challenge."
		},

			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ConnectionPainter for Connection Lines",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of ConnectionPainter into detailed subtasks covering: 1) CustomPainter setup and basic line drawing, 2) Curved and straight line rendering algorithms, 3) Line routing logic to avoid overlaps, 4) Support for different connection types with visual distinctions, and 5) Integration with connection state data.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex graphics programming with CustomPainter. The routing logic to avoid line overlaps requires sophisticated algorithms. Supporting multiple connection types with distinct visuals adds complexity, as does the need to integrate with connection state data. The accessibility requirements for high contrast further complicate the implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Add Connection Labeling with Bus Indicators",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of connection labeling into detailed subtasks covering: 1) Label data structure design, 2) Text rendering on connection lines, 3) Visual styling for different modes (replace/mix), 4) Label positioning algorithm for readability, and 5) Integration with existing ConnectionPainter.",
			"reasoning": "Adding labels to connection lines requires careful positioning and rendering to ensure readability. The task involves extending the ConnectionPainter with text rendering capabilities and implementing logic to determine optimal label placement. The visual styling for different modes adds moderate complexity, but the core challenge is integrating text with the existing line drawing system."

			"taskTitle": "Integrate Toolbar Actions with DistingCubit",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of toolbar actions with DistingCubit into detailed subtasks covering: 1) Action handler implementation, 2) DistingCubit connection and method calls, 3) State update and error handling, 4) Visual feedback for actions, and 5) Testing and validation of the integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep integration with the application's state management system. The developer needs to implement multiple action handlers, connect them to the DistingCubit, handle errors appropriately, and provide visual feedback. Understanding the existing Cubit architecture and ensuring proper state updates adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Connection State Management with RoutingEditorCubit",

			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex state management system that handles multiple aspects of the routing editor. The developer needs to design a robust state model, implement various state-changing methods, integrate with hardware synchronization, and ensure proper persistence. The error handling requirements and integration with existing systems make this one of the most complex tasks in the project."

			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple interaction states with precise coordinate transforms and visual feedback. The developer needs to handle hover, drag, drop, and selection states, each with its own complexity. The requirement for accurate hit testing and coordinate transforms adds technical difficulty, as does the need for accessibility support across all interaction types."

The developer needs to implement utility methods that handle complex matrix transformations for accurate positioning. The viewport panning and boundary constraints add interaction complexity, while the grid guideline rendering requires additional custom painting logic."

			"reasoning": "This task focuses on making the routing editor accessible and responsive across different devices. While it doesn't involve complex algorithms, it requires careful attention to detail across multiple dimensions of accessibility. The developer needs to implement responsive layouts, add semantic labels, enable keyboard navigation, optimize for touch, and ensure proper contrast ratios, each requiring specific expertise."
