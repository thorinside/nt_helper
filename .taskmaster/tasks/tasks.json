Use the RoutingFactory to determine the routing type and port layout at runtime. Ensure the widget visually distinguishes between different port types and supports extensibility for future routing types.\n\n2. **ConnectionLine Widget**: Implement a custom painter widget that draws bezier curves between ports, supporting smooth, visually appealing connections. Use Flutter's CustomPainter and Path APIs, following best practices for performance and hit-testing. Allow for interactive feedback (e.g., highlighting on hover or selection).\n\n3. **RoutingCanvas Widget**: Compose the overall routing visualization by orchestrating AlgorithmNode and ConnectionLine widgets. The canvas should listen to the RoutingEditorCubit for state changes and update the UI reactively. Ensure the layout adapts to changes in the routing state, such as adding/removing nodes or connections.\n\n4. **Integration with RoutingFactory**: Use dependency injection (get_it) to access the RoutingFactory and instantiate the correct routing implementation for each algorithm node. Ensure that port layouts and connection validation are delegated to the appropriate routing class, demonstrating polymorphic behavior in the UI.\n\n5. **Reactive State Management**: Integrate with the existing Cubit (RoutingEditorCubit) for state updates. Use BlocBuilder or similar patterns to ensure widgets rebuild efficiently in response to routing state changes. Avoid unnecessary rebuilds by leveraging keys and widget composition best practices.\n\n6. **Widget Testing**: Write comprehensive widget tests using flutter_test and mockito (or mocktail) to verify correct rendering, port layout adaptation, connection drawing, and interaction (e.g., drag-and-drop, selection). Test edge cases such as rapid state changes, empty states, and invalid connections.\n\n7. **Best Practices**: Follow Flutter best practices for custom painting, widget composition, and performance optimization.
