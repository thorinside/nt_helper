  "description": "This algorithm is a complete polyphonic synthesizer using wavetable oscillators. Each voice has two envelopes, a filter and an LFO. It is inspired by the original Poly Wavetable algorithm on the disting EX. The display shows notes being played with superimposed envelope bars for each voice, along with the waveform of the most recently played note's wavetable.",
