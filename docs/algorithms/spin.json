  "description": "This algorithm allows you to run what are effectively DSP \"plug‑ins\", loaded from the MicroSD card. It was designed particularly to support programs written for the Spin Semiconductor (http://www.spinsemi.com/) FV-1 chip. The popular IC has ended up in numerous products including some Eurorack modules (e.g. the FX, Aid and the Timiszoara). Its popularity and the relative ease of developing for it has led to a large number of (generally open source) DSP programs being available, and this that the Three Pot algorithm was designed to leverage. The name \"Three Pot\" comes from the FV-1 hardware design – all it has are stereo inputs and outputs, and connections for three pots for user controls. Although the focus is on converted FV‑1 programs, the conversion works by translating the programs to C++ and then compiling them for the disting NT – so you can if you like actually write C++ directly and use this algorithm to run it on the module.",
