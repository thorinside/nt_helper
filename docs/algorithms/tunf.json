  "description": "This algorithm provides four simultaneous tuners. It uses an autocorrelation pitch detection method which is fairly CPU heavy, but which provides reliable pitch detection for most signals. For simpler tones, you may prefer the \"Tuner (simple)\" algorithm. Microtuning via Scala or MTS is supported.",
