  "description": "This algorithm generates chaotic CVs according to a variety of so-called ‘attractors’, including the well-known Lorenz equations [60]. Each generates three CVs, named X, Y, and Z, which are available on separate outputs. You can modify the parameters of the Lorenz equation – ‘Rho mod’ affects 'r' (aka 'ρ'), and ‘Beta mod’ affects 'b' (aka 'β'). With the values at 0V, the parameters are the classic values as studied by Lorenz (28 and 8/3 respectively).",
