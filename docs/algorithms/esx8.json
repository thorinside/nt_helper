  "description": "This algorithm allows you to drive the outputs of an ESX-8CV module attached to an ES-5 expander which is in turn attached to the disting NT. The 'Adaptive' parameter controls whether the algorithm updates all eight hardware outputs continuously (non-adaptive mode) or only those that are changing (adaptive mode). In non-adaptive mode, each output is updated sequentially at 2kHz when running at a sample rate of 48kHz, as each update takes three samples and 24 samples are required to cycle through all eight outputs. In adaptive mode, the update rate varies based on how many channels are changing: one channel changes at 16kHz, two at 8kHz, down to 2kHz for all eight channels changing simultaneously.",
