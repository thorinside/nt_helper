  "description": "This algorithm tracks the pitch and envelope of an audio signal, which are output as CVs. It can also generate chords to harmonise with the tracked pitch – either as pitch CVs (to drive VCOs etc.) or as pitch shifter CVs (to drive the Pitch Shifter, to make harmony copies of the tracked audio). The chords can be tuned microtonally using Scala or MTS.",
