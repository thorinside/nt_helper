  "description": "This algorithm is a multi-channel, multi-band, parametric EQ.\nEach channel can process a number of busses - you might typically have a channel processing one or two busses for a mono or stereo signal, but you could, say, process all 12 of the inputs with the same EQ settings by using a single channel with a width of 12.\nThe display shows a graphical representation of the EQ curve for the current channel. The frequency and gain of the current band within the channel is indicated with a small box.",
