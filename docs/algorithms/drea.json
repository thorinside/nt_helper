  "description": "This algorithm is an implementation of the original Dream Machine algorithm on the disting EX. It is designed to generate drones, allowing the user to explore non-traditional harmonies based on prime ratios. Inspired by composer La Monte Young's theories, it generates five sounds—a fundamental and four harmonics—using wavetable synthesis (or pure sine/triangle/square waves for the fundamental). Each tone has an attack/release envelope controlled by its own gate parameter. By default, little is mapped to CV inputs, but users can map them as FM inputs or control gates.",
