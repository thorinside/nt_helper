  "name": "Arpeggiator",
  "description": "This algorithm is a very flexible arpeggiator, in some respects an interactive, performance-oriented sequencer. It is based on the arpeggiator in our FH-2 module and takes MIDI or CV/gate input to generate MIDI and/or CV/gate output. The key feature is mapping 'Commands' parameters alongside playing notes to manipulate patterns. When used as a MIDI-to-MIDI arpeggiator, set its output channel differently from the input to avoid MIDI consumption conflicts with other algorithms in disting NT.",

Three lines represent: full arpeggiation pattern, octave range (when 'Range' is active), and single-octave notes. In 'As Played' modes, the lowest line shows actual note numbers. '--' indicates rests; truncated steps appear greyed out.",
