  "description": "This algorithm provides four simultaneous tuners. It uses a simple pitch detection method which will only work reliably for simple tones, but happily 'simple tones' covers most of those that you will get from an analogue VCO, which in a Eurorack environment you might find yourself tuning quite often. Being simple, it consumes little CPU. Microtuning via Scala or MTS is supported.",

  "gui_description": "The display shows the detected pitch of the active channels, as a MIDI note number and cents, and as a value in Hz. It also shows a bar which grows to the left or right depending on how flat or sharp the note is relative to the 'true' pitch of the detected note.",
