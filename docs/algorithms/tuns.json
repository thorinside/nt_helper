  "description": "This algorithm provides four simultaneous tuners using a simple pitch detection method which will only work reliably for simple tones. These are typically found in analogue VCOs within a Eurorack environment, where tuning is often required. Microtuning via Scala or MTS is supported, and the algorithm consumes little CPU due to its simplicity.",
