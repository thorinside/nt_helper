  "description": "This algorithm is based on the Frequency Shifter algorithm on the disting EX. You may like to view [the video on that algorithm, which is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaH9u9E2K9k) [72] . The algorithm is a frequency shifter. Note that this is very different from a pitch shifter. A pitch shifter multiplies the frequencies of the constituent harmonics of a sound by the same amount, and so preserves their harmonic relationship. A frequency shifter adds a shift to the frequencies of the constituent harmonics of a sound, and so tends to break harmonic relationships, making sounds more ‘clangorous’ or ‘bell-like’.",
