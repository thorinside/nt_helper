  "description": "This algorithm generates simple attack/release or attack/decay envelopes. It is based on the disting mk4 algorithm “E-1 AR Envelope”. In the disting mk4 version the envelope times were always set together from a single knob; this version adds the option of setting them independently. The envelope times and shapes are set globally; each output channel can however be independently scaled and offset. In “Attack/release” mode, the envelope will rise to full level and stay there as long as the input is high. In “Attack/decay” mode, the envelope will execute one full attack/decay cycle in response to a trigger input. In “Looped AD” mode, the envelope will continually execute attack/decay cycles as long as the trigger input is high. In “Macro (asymmetric)” mode, the “Joint time” parameter sweeps from short A & D, through short A & long D, through long A & D, through long A & short D, and finally back to short A & D. In “Macro (symmetric)” mode, the “Joint time” parameter sets the A & D times to the same value, from very short times (about 10ms) to very long times (about 8s). Note that the actual times are heavily dependent on the shape parameters.",
