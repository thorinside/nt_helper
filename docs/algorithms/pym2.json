  "description": "This algorithm is a polysynth where each voice is essentially a Plaits (the open source Plaits module by Émilie Gillet). It features multiple voices (1-8) with synthesis models inspired by the original Plaits, offering rich sound design capabilities through parameters like harmonics, timbre, morph, and modulation controls. The display shows notes being played by various voices, which theoretically decay forever.",
