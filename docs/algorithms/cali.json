  "description": "This algorithm offers oscillator calibration, similar to that in our Silent Way Voice Controller VST plug-in, in the FH-2 module, and in various algorithms on the disting EX. Pass the pitch CV from another algorithm (e.g., Quantizer) or another module through this algorithm, and connect the output to your VCO’s CV input. To perform calibration, connect an output from the VCO back into this algorithm. Set 'Start' to 'On' to begin calibration, which outputs voltages (-4V to +6V) and analyzes the pitch of the resulting signal from the VCO, drawing a graph of results. Once complete, it continuously modifies incoming pitch CVs to achieve expected frequencies on the VCO. Calibration requires a clean waveform (e.g., sine or triangle). The process calibrates the *combination* of disting NT output and VCO, accounting for physical tuning knobs, temperature, etc.",
