  "description": "This algorithm plays samples from the MicroSD card. It is loosely based on the “SD 6 Triggers” algorithm on the disting EX. Whereas the “Poly Multisample” algorithm is aimed more at playing pitched instruments, this algorithm is mainly designed for playing simple one-shot samples e.g. drums. It supports both velocity switches and round robins per sample.\n\nThe trigger inputs are velocity sensitive – the voltage of the gate signal is used like the velocity of a MIDI note. 5V corresponds to maximum velocity.",
