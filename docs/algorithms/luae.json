  "description": "This algorithm allows you to define an arbitrary CV or audio process by simply entering a line of text on the module, for example “a + b” to add two signals together. It is designed to catch those little corner cases where stringing together, say, a bunch of attenuverters would be tedious, and writing a full blown Lua script seems like overkill (or, if you’re out and about without a computer on which to write the script). For more extensive discussion of Lua on the disting NT, see the Lua Script algorithm and the UI Scripts.",
