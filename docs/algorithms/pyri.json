  "description": "It's lots of Rings! This algorithm is a polysynth where each voice is essentially a Rings (the open source Rings module by Émilie Gillet). Rings itself does support a kind of polyphony, but it’s limited by having a single pitch and gate input – it’s very much designed so that only one note is triggered at a time. This algorithm gives you a full Rings implementation for each voice, with the convenience of shared parameter control.",
