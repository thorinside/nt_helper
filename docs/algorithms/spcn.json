  "description": "Spectral Conquest is an effect plug-in that lets you directly manipulate the frequency spectrum of audio signals using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The incoming signal is analyzed into narrow frequency bands, allowing modification before regeneration via Inverse FFT. Originally a VST plugin from 2010, this algorithm provides parameter-based spectral manipulation instead of direct mouse interaction, including keyboard-controlled chordal resonance and sequential processing of shift, gate, comb, sieve, polysynth, and filter effects.",
