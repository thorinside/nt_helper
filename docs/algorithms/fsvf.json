  "description": "This algorithm is a voltage controlled filter using the common ‘State Variable’ topology, which yields simultaneous low-, band-, and highpass filter responses.\n\nAll three filter outputs are available individually, plus an output which can be blended from lowpass, through bandpass, to highpass.\n\nThe input and the various outputs use a contiguous range of busses, starting with the one set via the parameters, and with the channel count set by the ‘Width’ parameter. For example, to filter stereo signals, set the Width to 2.",
