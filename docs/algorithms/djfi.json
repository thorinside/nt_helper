  "description": "This algorithm is an implementation of the disting mk4 algorithm of the same name. You may like to review the video about that algorithm, which explains its behavior and applications. The filter sweeps from lowpass to highpass on a single control called Sweep. At the central (zero) position, no filtering occurs ('>DRY<'). Negative sweep values apply a lowpass filter with cutoff decreasing as the value becomes more negative; positive sweep values apply a highpass filter with cutoff increasing as the value goes positive. A deadzone around zero ensures no unintended filtering when near the dry position.",
