  "description": "This algorithm is an implementation of the disting mk4 algorithm of the same name. It functions as a filter that sweeps from lowpass to highpass on a single control. The Sweep parameter sets the filter cutoff, with zero position applying no effect (indicated by '>DRY<'). Negative sweep values apply a lowpass filter with decreasing cutoff frequency, while positive sweep values apply a highpass filter with increasing cutoff frequency.",
