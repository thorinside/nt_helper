  "description": "This algorithm is based on the Dual Waveshaper algorithm on the disting mk4. You may like to watch [the video on that algorithm here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B1VzxQ2qOo) [118] . From the disting mk4 manual:\n\"Type 0 is what is usually termed a wavefolder. This increases the harmonic content of the sound in\ninteresting ways, especially as the gain changes.\n\"Type 1 is a triangle-to-sine waveshaper. Used on most audio this is a relatively gentle form of\noverdrive/saturation. However, when fed with the right level of triangle wave, the output is exactly a\nsine wave, which is useful when you have a triangle wave VCO handy but really want a pure sine\nwave instead.\n\"\"",
