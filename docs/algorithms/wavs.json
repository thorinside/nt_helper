  "description": "This algorithm is based on the Dual Waveshaper algorithm from the disting mk4. It features two distinct waveshaping modes: Type 0 (wavefolder) and Type 1 (triangle-to-sine shaper).\n\n**Type 0 - Wavefolder:** This mode increases harmonic content in interesting ways, particularly as the gain changes.\n\n**Type 1 - Triangle-to-Sine Waveshaper:** When used on most audio signals, this provides a relatively gentle form of overdrive/saturation. However, when fed with an appropriate level of triangle wave input (such as from a VCO), it outputs a pure sine wave, which can be useful for generating clean sine waves while retaining the flexibility of a triangle wave source.\n\nThe GUI displays how an input sine wave is affected by the waveshaper, serving as a graphical aid to visualize the amount of waveshaping applied. It does not function as an oscilloscope and will only accurately reflect audio behavior when fed with a sine wave.",

It is not an oscilloscope – it’s not showing what your actual audio looks like (unless you happen to be feeding it a sine wave). It’s just a graphical aid to get an idea of how much waveshaping is being applied.",
