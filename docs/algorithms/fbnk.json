  "description": "This algorithm is based on the disting EX filter/resonator bank. It provides a configurable number of parallel filters (1-12) that can be mono, stereo, or up to 8 channels wide. The original disting EX implementation offered eight stereo bandpass filters or resonators with adjustable levels via CV/envelopes and pitch control via MIDI/CV. This version extends the filter count to 12 and introduces three modes: Resonator (peaking all-pass filters emphasizing narrow frequency bands), Bandpass (attenuating frequencies away from center points), and Multiband (crossover-based, like a multiband compressor). Filters can be manually controlled or driven by MIDI/CV/gates, with resonance/Q settings, envelope attack/release times, and individual gain controls. The GUI displays filter tuning notes overlaid on voice-level envelopes.",
