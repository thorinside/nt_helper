  "description": "This algorithm allows you to automatically create multi-sampled instruments in a format that can be used by the Poly Multisample algorithm, by triggering an external synth (by MIDI or CV/gate) and recording the resulting audio. You can set the range of notes to be sampled, and the step size (e.g., every note, every fourth note etc.). You can also choose to sample multiple velocity levels per note, and multiple round-robins of each note. The samples are stored on the MicroSD card, in a folder within the root ‘samples’ folder.",
