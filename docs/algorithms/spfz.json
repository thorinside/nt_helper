  "name": "Spectral Freeze",
  "description": "This algorithm is an audio ‘freeze’ effect – it captures sound at a moment in time and sustains it indefinitely. The 'spectral' part of the name indicates that it works in the frequency domain, unlike simple loopers or granular effects which work in the time domain. It captures the spectrum of a sound (using an FFT) and uses that to resynthesize audio via phase vocoder technique. As well as completely freezing sound, the algorithm can play it back at any desired speed (time stretching) and pitch. Multiple 'voices' allow freezing different moments of audio simultaneously.",
