  "name": "Looper",
  "description": "This algorithm is a looper based on the disting EX version but significantly extended. It supports up to four simultaneous loops with crossfades, fade-in/out, overdubbing, and synchronization to clock inputs or MIDI clocks. Features include loop reversal, half-speed playback (octave down), layers for undo/redo functionality, envelope controls for smooth transitions, and a two-button record/play/overdub paradigm. The looper can also generate clocks (analog/MIDI) and includes a dedicated MIDI-note interface for pedalboard integration. Memory usage depends on loop time, bit depth, and stereo/mono settings.",
