  "description": "This algorithm is a looper, based on the disting EX algorithm of the same name, but significantly extended. Loops can have crossfades, they can fade in and out, and overdubbing can fade in and out, all of which is designed to make it easy to achieve smooth, ambient looping. All looping operations can also be synchronised to a clock input, if tight rhythmic looping is more your thing. The looper can also generate clocks (analogue and/or MIDI), if you prefer the looper to be the source of tempo in your setup. Loops may also be reversed, and played at half speed (an octave down). A ‘layers’ system is also implemented, which is like the ‘undo/redo’ found on some loopers but more powerful. The core control setup is a two button record/play/overdub paradigm in the manner of many stompbox loopers, though many more controls are available. These can be mapped to CV, MIDI, or I2C as usual; a dedicated MIDI-note based interface is also provided for ease of use with MIDI pedalboards which send notes when footswitches are pressed. You may like to review the Debouncer algorithm (above) which is designed to make it easy to hook guitar footswitches to the looper controls. A UI script (see below for information about UI scripts) is available which puts the looper’s main record/play buttons on the module’s two encoders. This is available from our GitHub https://github.com/expertsleepersltd/distingNT if it’s not already on your MicroSD card.",
