  "description": "These two algorithms are taken together as they form a mechanism to introduce feedback into presets. Though perhaps misnamed – they can just as easily feed forward. Think of them as two ends of a teleport/hyperspace tunnel: what goes in one end (the send) comes out of the other (the receive). If the receive is placed above the send in the preset, you have feedback; if the receive is placed after the send, you create a way to teleport busses past a section of the preset. Both algorithms have an 'Identifier' parameter that allows matching up send/receive pairs if there is more than one. The send and receive can process a number of channels (1-8), but if these don't match, only the smaller number will be processed. Be careful when setting up feedback loops: the receive's gain defaults to fully silent (-40 dB) for safety reasons.",
