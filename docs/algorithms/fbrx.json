  "description": "These two algorithms are taken together, as they are two parts of a mechanism to introduce feedback into presets. Though perhaps they are misnamed \u2013 they can just as easily feed forward. Think of them as two ends of a teleport/hyperspace tunnel \u2013 what goes in one end (the send) comes out of the other (the receive). If the receive is placed above the send in the preset you have feedback; if the receive is placed after the send, you have a way of teleporting busses past a section of the preset. Both algorithms have an \u2018Identifier\u2019 parameter. This allows the system to match up send/receive pairs if there is more than one. The send and receive can process a number of channels, according to the specifications. If these don\u2019t match, the smaller number of channels will be processed. Be careful when setting up feedback loops. There\u2019s a reason that the receive\u2019s gain parameter defaults to fully silent. Raise this with caution.",
