  "description": "These two algorithms are taken together, as they are two parts of a mechanism to introduce feedback into presets. Though perhaps they are misnamed – they can just as easily feed forward. Think of them as two ends of a teleport/hyperspace tunnel – what goes in one end (the send) comes out of the other (the receive). If the receive is placed above the send in the preset you have feedback; if the receive is placed after the send, you have a way of teleporting busses past a section of the preset. Both algorithms have an ‘Identifier’ parameter. This allows the system to match up send/receive pairs if there is more than one. The send and receive can process a number of channels, according to the specifications. If these don’t match, the smaller number of channels will be processed. Be careful when setting up feedback loops. There’s a reason that the receive’s gain parameter defaults to fully silent. Raise this with caution.",
