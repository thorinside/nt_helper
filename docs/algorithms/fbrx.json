  "description": "These two algorithms are taken together as they form a mechanism to introduce feedback into presets. Though perhaps misnamed – they can just as easily feed forward. Think of them as two ends of a teleport/hyperspace tunnel: what goes in one end (the send) comes out the other (the receive). If the receive is placed above the send in the preset, you have feedback; if placed after the send, it acts as a way to teleport busses past a section of the preset.\n\nBoth algorithms share an 'Identifier' parameter to match up send/receive pairs when multiple exist. The number of channels processed depends on specifications (1-8). If channel counts mismatch, only the smaller number is processed.\n\n**Warning:** Be cautious with feedback loops; the receive's gain defaults to -40dB (silent) for safety.",
