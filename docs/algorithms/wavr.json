  "description": "This algorithm records WAV files to the MicroSD card. A typical use for this would be to record the module's inputs, but any bus can be the source for a recording, so you could also record the output of other algorithms - for example, you could run a mixer and record the stereo mix-down. The algorithm can also play back its recordings. It does so to the same bus channels as are chosen for recording. Since the module is fully DC-coupled, it can also record and play CVs. Up to 10 files can be recorded simultaneously, each mono or stereo. It goes without saying that the more files you record, and the larger the chosen bit depth, the more demands are placed on the MicroSD card. You would be advised to check your card performance before relying on the algorithm for any crucial recordings.",

  "gui_description": "The display shows a level meter for each file. This will be grayed out if the file is disabled. The meters show the input levels when idle or recording, and the playback levels when playing. While recording, the display shows the name of the current recording, and the elapsed time. It also shows a gauge of the pressure on the MicroSD card. When idle, the display shows the name of the last recording completed or played. During playback, the display shows the name of the recording being played, and the elapsed time.",
