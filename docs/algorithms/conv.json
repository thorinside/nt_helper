  "description": "This algorithm performs real-time convolution of the input signal and another signal (often called an impulse response), which is loaded from the MicroSD card. This is often used for realistic reverb effects, since the required impulse responses can be sampled from a physical location, but the technique is much more general and can be a very creative way to mangle and combine sounds. Convolution is notoriously CPU-intensive, and the disting NT is a resource-constrained embedded system â€“ you should not expect to achieve the same results as you might in the latest new fangled convolution reverb plug-in in your DAW, with orders of magnitude more CPU power and RAM. However, this algorithm remains a useful tool within the context of a modular synth. The algorithm is based on the disting EX algorithm of the same name. There is an in-depth video for that algorithm here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDFZA9b2A0Y. The algorithm is based on the disting EX algorithm of the same name.
