  "name": "Convolver",
  "description": "This algorithm performs real-time convolution of the input signal and another signal (often called an 'impulse response'), which is loaded from the MicroSD card. Convolution is a technique used for realistic reverb effects by sampling impulse responses from physical locations, but it can also be applied creatively to mangle and combine sounds. The disting NT is a resource-constrained embedded system, so this algorithm will not achieve the same results as high-end convolution reverbs in DAWs with more CPU power and RAM. However, it remains useful within modular synthesis contexts.",

      "name": "Sample rate",
      "value": "48kHz (fixed for all algorithms)",
      "description": "All disting NT algorithms run at a fixed sample rate of 48kHz. The 'Sample rate' parameter allows internal downsampling to lower rates (48kHz, 24kHz, 12kHz, or 6kHz) for longer impulse times but reduced audio bandwidth."

      "name": "Max impulse length",
      "value": "1-10 seconds",
      "description": "The maximum length of the impulse response sample that can be processed depends on allocated memory, mono/stereo mode, latency settings, and internal downsampling. Longer impulses are generally desirable for reverb applications."

    {
      "name": "CPU usage",
      "value": "High (resource-constrained system)",
      "description": "Convolution is notoriously CPU-intensive. The disting NT's limited resources mean the algorithm will not perform as efficiently as high-end convolution reverbs in DAWs, but it remains functional within modular synthesis constraints."

      "description": "The algorithm processes audio in blocks. Latency can be adjusted to balance between lower latency (shorter impulse times) and higher latency (longer impulse times). Dry signal remains synced with convolution output regardless of latency."
