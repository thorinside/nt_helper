# No High Contrast Mode Detection or Support

**Severity: Medium**

## Files Affected
- `lib/disting_app.dart` (theme configuration)
- All UI files

## Description

The app does not check `MediaQuery.of(context).highContrast` or `MediaQuery.of(context).accessibleNavigation`. While the app uses Material 3 with `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` which provides reasonable contrast, there is no enhanced high-contrast mode for users who need it.

Additionally, the `AccessibilityColors` class (`lib/ui/widgets/routing/accessibility_colors.dart`) implements WCAG contrast ratio calculations but is **never imported or used** in any rendering code.

## Impact on Low-Vision Users

- Users who enable high contrast mode on their device see no difference
- The routing editor's color-coded connections may not meet contrast ratios
- Port type differentiation relies solely on color with no shape/pattern alternatives

## Recommended Fix

1. Check `MediaQuery.of(context).highContrast` and provide enhanced contrast theme
2. Actually integrate `AccessibilityColors` into the rendering pipeline
3. Add non-color differentiators (shapes, patterns, icons) for port types and connection states
