# Implementation summary
implementation_notes: |
  Core changes:
  1. lib/core/routing/es5_encoder_algorithm_routing.dart:227
     - Changed output port channelNumber from channel index to Output parameter value
  2. lib/cubit/routing_editor_cubit.dart:775-838
     - Added _assignEs5EncoderOutput() for drag-and-drop to ES-5 ports
  3. Connection discovery automatically works via port.channelNumber property

  Pattern compliance:
  - Follows OO routing framework (AlgorithmRouting â†’ ConnectionDiscoveryService)
  - Drag-and-drop uses same patterns as Clock/Euclidean ES-5 routing (ES5I.2)
  - Bidirectional sync via reactive DistingCubit stream

  Test coverage:
  - Existing ES-5 Encoder tests pass without modification
  - All 587 tests pass
  - flutter analyze: zero warnings
