# Quality Gate Decision - ES5.007
# Schema version 1

schema: 1
story: "ES5.007"
story_title: "Clock/Euclidean ES-5 Connections"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with excellent test coverage (10 tests). Code follows established patterns, zero analyzer warnings, all tests passing. Minor code duplication between Clock/Euclidean classes is acceptable technical debt."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
