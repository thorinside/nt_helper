nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Platform channel isolation appropriate. No sensitive data handling in this layer."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Subscription cleanup prevents resource leaks. Event-driven architecture minimizes polling overhead. Frame generation at 15 FPS is reasonable for test pipeline validation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling on all async paths. Device disconnection during initialization handled gracefully. Multiple stream lifecycle cycles tested and validated."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear naming conventions followed. Debug logging comprehensive. Code is self-documenting with proper async/await patterns. Follows project coding standards."

compliance:
  coding_standards: "✓ PASS - Zero analyzer warnings, proper async/await patterns, correct debug output"
  project_structure: "✓ PASS - Follows established patterns for platform channel implementation"
  testing_strategy: "✓ PASS - Appropriate unit test coverage for platform boundary code"
  acceptance_criteria: "✓ PASS - All 4 ACs met with test validation"

notes: |
  This implementation represents production-ready code with excellent engineering discipline. The event-driven approach properly mirrors the underlying uvccamera package semantics. Platform channel error handling is defensive without being overly verbose.

  **Integration Testing Note:** Unit tests cannot fully exercise platform channel behavior (MissingPluginException in test environment is expected). Full validation requires physical Android device with Disting NT connected. This is documented in story testing requirements.
