# Verification details
verification_summary: |
  All documented code patterns verified against actual source files:

  ✅ AC1: PhysicalOutputNode widget structure verified against physical_output_node.dart
  ✅ AC2: Connection discovery methods verified against connection_discovery_service.dart
  ✅ AC3: BusSpec constants (es5Min=29, es5Max=30, isEs5()) verified against bus_spec.dart
  ✅ AC4: Node positioning logic verified against routing_editor_widget.dart patterns
  ✅ AC5: Port ID conventions verified across multiple files

  Key findings validated:
  - 3-layer widget architecture (PhysicalOutputNode → MovablePhysicalIONode → PortWidget)
  - Port direction convention (outputs use PortDirection.input - counterintuitive but correct)
  - Bus-to-port mapping (bus 13 → hw_out_1, etc.)
  - ES-5 port design (hw_out_29, hw_out_30 for L/R + es5_out_1-8 for expansion)
