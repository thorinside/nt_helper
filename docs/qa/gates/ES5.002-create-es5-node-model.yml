    requirement: "ES-5 node class created following the exact pattern discovered in Story ES5-001"
    coverage: "Class constants verified in test group (lines 7-28)"
    status: VERIFIED
  - ac: 2
    requirement: "Exactly 10 input ports created with correct types (L/R as audio, 1-8 as gate)"
    coverage: "Port count, type, and configuration tests (lines 37-74, 247-254)"
    status: VERIFIED

# Test architecture assessment
test_assessment:
  coverage_level: "Excellent"
  test_count: 27
  test_organization: "Well-structured with logical groups"
  edge_cases: "Comprehensive (invalid port numbers, null nodeId)"
  integration_tests: "Verify consistency between batch and individual port getters"
  notes: |
    - All acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
    - Edge cases thoroughly covered (0, -1, 9, 10 for port numbers)
    - Error messages validated
    - Integration tests ensure consistency across different access methods
    - Test execution is fast and reliable

# Recommendations (none blocking)
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider extracting port creation logic to reduce duplication if configuration becomes more complex"
      refs: ["lib/core/routing/models/es5_hardware_node.dart"]
      priority: low
      note: "Current duplication is acceptable and well-tested, but watch for complexity growth"
