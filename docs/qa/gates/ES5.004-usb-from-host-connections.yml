    - 'Mixed USB outputs (ES-5 and standard) handled correctly'
    - 'Standard output routing (buses 13-20) remains unchanged'
    - 'ES-5 detection occurs before standard hardware logic'

architecture_assessment:
  design_quality: 'Excellent - follows established patterns with minimal intrusion'
  code_placement: 'Correct - logic added to appropriate service method'
  abstraction_level: 'Appropriate - uses existing BusSpec.isEs5() utility'
  separation_of_concerns: 'Maintained - routing discovery logic properly isolated'
