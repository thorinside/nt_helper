# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper bounds checking, no user input sanitization issues, uses controlled enums/numbers"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimized reactive updates, toggle data extraction only on widget builds, connection discovery only when slots/parameters change"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with null safety, proper state management via reactive architecture"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns, follows established patterns, excellent debug logging"

# Implementation details
implementation_summary:
  files_modified: 3
  files_added: 0
  key_changes:
    - "algorithm_node_widget.dart: Added ES-5 toggle UI with visual states"
    - "routing_editor_widget.dart: Added toggle data extraction and click handler"
    - "routing_editor_cubit.dart: Added ES-5 direct output connection assignment"

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns - UI extracts data, Cubit handles business logic"
    - "Proper reactive state management - bidirectional sync automatic via DistingCubit stream"
    - "Follows established patterns for UI controls and parameter updates"
    - "Excellent debug logging throughout for troubleshooting"
    - "Robust error handling with null safety"
    - "Zero flutter analyze warnings"
    - "All 587 tests pass"

  design_decisions_validated:
    - "Toggle switches between 0 (Off) and 1 (Expander 1) - matches AC #2"
    - "Connection deletion preserves ES-5 Expander mode (AC #7) - less surprising UX"
    - "ES-5 Output parameter retained when connection deleted - allows reconnection"

  architecture_integration:
    - "Toggle data extracted via regex pattern matching from live Slot"
    - "ES-5 connection creation integrated into existing bus assignment flow"
    - "Port generation in Es5DirectOutputAlgorithmRouting handles dual-mode"
