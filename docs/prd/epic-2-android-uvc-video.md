# Epic: Android UVC Video Integration - Platform Completion

## Epic Goal

Complete cross-platform USB video support by implementing UVC camera integration for Android, enabling Disting NT display streaming on Android devices to match functionality already working on iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current relevant functionality:** nt_helper successfully streams Disting NT display (256x64 @ 15fps) via USB video on iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Android has stub implementation with test frame generation only.
- **Technology stack:** Flutter with platform-specific USB video plugins (AVFoundation for iOS/macOS, custom implementations for Windows/Linux), UVCCamera library (16KB compliance branch) already integrated for Android
- **Integration points:** `UsbVideoManager` (lib/domain/video/), `UsbVideoChannel` (lib/services/platform_channels/), `AndroidUsbVideoChannel` (Android-specific), `VideoFrameCubit` for frame display, EventChannel streaming pattern

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added/changed:**
  - Replace mock frame generation in `AndroidUsbVideoChannel` with actual UVCCamera controller integration
  - Extract raw frame bytes from UVCCamera texture-based rendering for EventChannel streaming
  - Implement proper device permission handling for Android USB devices
  - Add frame format conversion (UVC formats → BMP/PNG for consistency with other platforms)

- **How it integrates:**
  - UVCCamera library already in pubspec.yaml (DigifinityLtd fork, 16KB compliance branch)
  - Follows existing EventChannel streaming pattern used by iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux
  - Integrates with `UsbVideoManager` via `AndroidUsbVideoChannel` interface
  - Uses `UvcCameraController` for device initialization and frame capture
  - Maintains cross-platform frame format (BMP/PNG bytes via EventChannel)

- **Success criteria:**
  - Android displays Disting NT video stream (256x64 @ 15fps) matching other platforms
  - USB device detection works correctly (Expert Sleepers VID 0x16C0)
  - Permission flow works on Android (camera + USB device permissions)
  - Frame streaming maintains ~15fps without drops
  - All operation modes work (with hardware connected)
  - Zero `flutter analyze` warnings

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1:** [UVCCamera Device Detection and Permission Handling](../stories/2.1.android-uvc-device-detection.md) - Replace stub `listUsbCameras()` and `requestUsbPermission()` in `AndroidUsbVideoChannel` with actual UVCCamera API calls, handle Android permission flow (camera + USB device) - **Status: Done** ✅

2. **Story 2.2:** [Integrate UVCameraController for Frame Capture](../stories/2.2.android-uvc-controller-integration.md) - Replace test frame generation with UVCameraController initialization, implement device event handling (attached/connected/disconnected), set up low resolution preset for Disting NT - **Status: Done** ✅

3. **Story 2.3:** [Extract and Stream Raw Frames via EventChannel](../stories/2.3.android-uvc-frame-streaming.md) - Implement frame extraction from UVCCamera texture/preview, convert to BMP/PNG format matching other platforms, stream via EventChannel to maintain cross-platform compatibility - **Status: Done** ✅

4. **Story 2.4:** [Handle Android Lifecycle and Error Recovery](../stories/2.4.android-lifecycle-error-recovery.md) - Implement proper cleanup on app pause/resume, handle USB disconnection/reconnection, add error handling for permission denial and device errors - **Status: Done** ✅

## Technical Architecture

### Current Cross-Platform Pattern

**iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux:**
```
AVCaptureSession → Frame Callback → BMP/PNG encoding → EventChannel → VideoFrameCubit
```

**Android (Target):**
```
UvcCameraController → Texture/Frame extraction → BMP/PNG encoding → EventChannel → VideoFrameCubit
```

### Key Integration Points

1. **UsbVideoChannel** (lib/services/platform_channels/usb_video_channel.dart)
   - Platform router: delegates to `AndroidUsbVideoChannel` on Android
   - Already handles iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux

2. **AndroidUsbVideoChannel** (lib/services/platform_channels/android_usb_video_channel.dart)
   - Current: Mock implementation with test frames
   - Target: UVCCamera integration with real frame capture

3. **UVCCamera Library API:**
   ```dart
   UvcCamera.getDevices() → Map<String, UvcCameraDevice>
   UvcCamera.requestDevicePermission(device) → bool
   UvcCamera.deviceEventStream → Stream<UvcCameraDeviceEvent>
   UvcCameraController(device, resolutionPreset) → controller
   controller.initialize() → Future<void>
   controller.textureId → int (for preview)
   ```

4. **Frame Extraction Challenge:**
   - UVCCamera uses GPU texture rendering
   - Need raw bytes for EventChannel (cross-platform pattern)
   - Options: texture readback, frame callback, or video recording interception

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Maintain existing cross-platform EventChannel streaming pattern
- [x] Frame format matches other platforms (BMP or PNG bytes)
- [x] Video resolution supports Disting NT (256x64 minimum)
- [x] Frame rate targets 15fps minimum
- [x] No changes to `UsbVideoManager` or `VideoFrameCubit` interfaces
- [x] Android 16KB page size compliance maintained (already handled via UVCCamera library)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** UVCCamera may not provide raw frame access (texture-only rendering)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Research: UVCCamera example shows texture-based preview only
  - Fallback 1: Use texture readback (glReadPixels equivalent in Flutter)
  - Fallback 2: Investigate video recording stream interception
  - Fallback 3: Platform channel to native for frame callback implementation
  - Worst case: Fork UVCCamera to add frame callback support

- **Secondary Risk:** Performance issues with frame conversion on Android
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use efficient native code for format conversion if needed
  - Profile frame pipeline on mid-range Android device
  - Optimize conversion path (direct YUV → BMP if possible)
  - Consider reducing frame rate if necessary (10fps acceptable)

- **Rollback Plan:** Android video feature remains disabled (current state); all other platforms continue working normally

## Definition of Done

## Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this platform completion epic. Key considerations:

- **This is platform-specific implementation** to match existing iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux functionality
- **Technology stack:** Flutter, UVCCamera library (already integrated), EventChannel streaming, Cubit state management
- **Integration points:**
  - `AndroidUsbVideoChannel` (lib/services/platform_channels/android_usb_video_channel.dart) - main implementation file
  - `UsbVideoChannel` (platform router) - no changes needed
  - `UsbVideoManager` (cross-platform manager) - no changes needed
  - `VideoFrameCubit` (frame display) - no changes needed
  - UVCCamera library API - external dependency
- **Existing patterns to follow:**
  - iOS/macOS implementations for reference (AVFoundation pattern)
  - EventChannel streaming pattern (send frame bytes)
  - Frame format: BMP or PNG encoding
  - Permission handling flow
  - Device lifecycle management
- **Technical Implementation Notes:**
  - UVCCamera API similar to Flutter camera package
  - Device events: attached/detached/connected/disconnected
  - Controller initialization requires camera permission first
  - Texture-based rendering (textureId) - need frame extraction strategy
  - Resolution preset: use 'low' for Disting NT (256x64)
  - Frame format conversion critical for cross-platform compatibility
- **Critical requirements:**
  - Must maintain EventChannel streaming pattern (platform consistency)
  - Frame format must match other platforms for VideoFrameCubit compatibility
  - Must handle Android permission model (runtime permissions)
  - Must support USB device hot-plug (attach/detach events)
  - Must pass `flutter analyze` with zero warnings (project standard)
- **Testing requirements:**
  - Requires physical Android device for testing (emulator lacks USB support)
  - Requires Disting NT hardware connected via USB
  - Must verify frame rate and visual quality
  - Must test permission denial scenarios
  - Must test USB disconnect/reconnect

Each story should focus on incremental functionality with clear acceptance criteria and testing verification."
