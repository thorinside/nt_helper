## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `test/integration/es5_routing_integration_test.dart` - New test file
- `test/core/routing/es5_bus_values_test.dart` - Existing ES-5 tests
- All modified files from Stories ES5-001 through ES5-007

### Test Scenarios Detail
USB From Host Test:
```dart
testWidgets('USB From Host to ES-5 L/R', (tester) async {
  // Setup
  final usbSlot = createSlot(
    algorithm: Algorithm(guid: 'usbf', name: 'USB Audio (From Host)'),
    // Ch1 to = 29, Ch2 to = 30
  );

  // Execute
  final routing = AlgorithmRouting.fromSlot(usbSlot);
  final connections = ConnectionDiscoveryService.discoverConnections([routing]);

  // Verify
  expect(connections.any((c) => c.destinationPortId == 'es5_L'), true);
  expect(connections.any((c) => c.destinationPortId == 'es5_R'), true);
});
```

Clock/Euclidean Test:
```dart
testWidgets('Clock with ES-5 Direct Output', (tester) async {
  // Setup with ES-5 parameters
  // Ch1: ES-5 Expander = 1, ES-5 Output = 3
  // Ch2: ES-5 Expander = 0, Output = 15

  // Verify
  // Ch1 → es5_3 (NOT to bus)
  // Ch2 → bus 15 (normal routing)
});
```

ES-5 Encoder Test:
```dart
testWidgets('ES-5 Encoder Mirror Connections', (tester) async {
  // Enable specific channels
  // Verify mirror outputs only for enabled
});
```

Node Display Test:
```dart
testWidgets('ES-5 Node Conditional Display', (tester) async {
  final cubit = RoutingEditorCubit();

  // No ES-5 algorithms
  expect(cubit.shouldShowEs5Node(), false);

  // Add ES-5 algorithm
  // expect(cubit.shouldShowEs5Node(), true);
});
```

Performance Considerations:
- Test with maximum connections (all algorithms, all channels)
- Measure connection discovery time
- Check rendering performance in routing widget
- Verify no memory leaks with node show/hide cycles

### Testing Standards
- All tests must pass before marking story complete
- Integration tests in test/integration/ directory
- Unit tests for individual components
- Manual visual inspection required for UI
- Performance baseline: Connection discovery < 100ms
- No console errors or warnings during test runs

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality with well-structured integration tests covering all ES-5 algorithm types. The test file demonstrates strong understanding of test architecture principles with clear organization, meaningful test names, and good use of helper functions to eliminate duplication. All 12 integration tests pass successfully with zero regression across the entire 241-test routing suite.

### Refactoring Performed

During review, identified and eliminated code duplication in test helper functions:

- **File**: test/integration/es5_routing_integration_test.dart:90-217
  - **Change**: Extracted common ES-5 direct output slot creation logic into shared `createEs5DirectOutputSlot` function
  - **Why**: `createClockSlot` and `createEuclideanSlot` were 100% identical except for algorithm guid/name, violating DRY principle
  - **How**: Created generic helper accepting guid/name as parameters, then wrapped it with algorithm-specific convenience functions. Reduces ~90 lines of duplication to single implementation.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Zero flutter analyze warnings, proper use of debugPrint, correct import ordering, appropriate file organization
- Project Structure: ✓ Integration tests correctly placed in test/integration/ directory
- Testing Strategy: ✓ All tests follow established patterns, proper use of test groups, clear assertions
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully validated with tests
