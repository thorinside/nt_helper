## Dev Notes

This is the final story in Epic 4. It ensures the new ES-5 support is properly documented for future developers and AI agents working on the codebase.

### Documentation Philosophy

**Brownfield Focus**:
- Documentation should help developers understand existing patterns
- Emphasize what exists and how to extend it
- Reference actual file paths and line numbers where helpful

**AI Agent Context**:
- CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE/ directory provide context for AI-driven development
- Architecture document serves as comprehensive reference
- Audit documents track implementation completeness

### Architecture Document Updates

**Location**: `docs/architecture.md`

**Routing System Section** (likely exists):
- Current text probably mentions Clock (clck) and Euclidean (eucp) ES-5 support
- Update to list all 5 algorithms: Clock, Euclidean, Clock Multiplier, Clock Divider, Poly CV
- Add GUIDs for quick reference: clck, eucp, clkm, clkd, pycv

**Epic 4 Completion Note**:
```markdown
## Epic 4: ES-5 Direct Output Support (Completed 2025-10-28)

Extended ES-5 direct output support to three additional algorithms added in firmware 1.12:
- Clock Multiplier (clkm)
- Clock Divider (clkd)
- Poly CV (pycv)

All ES-5-capable algorithms now supported (5 total):
1. Clock (clck) - Single-channel clock generator
2. Euclidean (eucp) - Multi-channel Euclidean rhythm generator
3. Clock Multiplier (clkm) - Single-channel clock multiplier
4. Clock Divider (clkd) - Multi-channel clock divider
5. Poly CV (pycv) - Polyphonic MIDI/CV converter (gates only)

**Base Class**: `lib/core/routing/es5_direct_output_algorithm_routing.dart`
- Handles dual-mode output logic (ES-5 direct vs. normal bus routing)
- Provides `createConfigFromSlot()` helper for factory creation
- Uses `es5_direct` bus marker for connection discovery

**Factory Registration**: `lib/core/routing/algorithm_routing.dart:309-330`
- Registration order: Clock, Euclidean, Clock Multiplier, Clock Divider, Poly
- Each implementation provides `canHandle()` and `createFromSlot()` methods

**ES-5 Behavior**:
- When ES-5 Expander > 0: Output routes to ES-5 port (normal Output parameter ignored)
- When ES-5 Expander = 0: Output uses normal bus assignment
- Poly CV: ES-5 applies to gate outputs only, not pitch/velocity CVs
```

### CLAUDE Documentation Updates

**Location**: `CLAUDE/index.md` (if routing section exists)

**Updates**:
- Add Epic 4 to project history
- Reference new routing implementation files
- Link to test files for examples

### Routing Audit Updates

**Location**: `docs/audit/routing_audit.md` (if exists)

**Updates**:
- Add Clock Multiplier to algorithm coverage list
- Add Clock Divider to algorithm coverage list
- Update Poly CV entry to note ES-5 support
- Document test coverage for new implementations

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Modify**:
- `docs/architecture.md` (required)
- `CLAUDE/index.md` (if routing section exists)
- `docs/audit/routing_audit.md` (if exists)

**No Code Changes**:

### Documentation Standards

**Markdown Formatting**:
- Use proper headers (##, ###)
- Use code blocks for file paths and code snippets
- Use bullet lists for feature lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps

**File References**:
- Always use relative paths from project root

- Keep paths up to date with file moves/renames

**Completeness**:
- Document all 5 ES-5 algorithms
- Include GUIDs for reference
- Reference base class and patterns
- Note any limitations or edge cases

### Verification

- [ ] Algorithm GUIDs included
- [ ] Base class referenced
- [ ] Factory registration location noted
- [ ] Dual-mode behavior explained
- [ ] Epic 4 completion date included

**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story E4.6 successfully completes Epic 4 documentation requirements. All acceptance criteria have been met with high-quality, consistent documentation updates across four key files. The documentation accurately reflects the ES-5 direct output support implementation completed in Epic 4, including all 5 ES-5-capable algorithms (Clock, Euclidean, Clock Multiplier, Clock Divider, Poly CV) with correct GUIDs, base class references, and behavioral descriptions.

The story followed documentation-only workflow appropriately with no code changes, proper markdown formatting, accurate file paths, and zero flutter analyze warnings. Epic 4 completion date (2025-10-28) is consistently documented across all files.

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- **Completeness**: All 4 target documentation files updated (architecture.md, CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE/routing-system.md, routing_audit.md)
- **Accuracy**: All algorithm GUIDs correct (clck, eucp, clkm, clkd, pycv), factory registration line numbers verified (309-340)
- **Consistency**: Epic 4 completion date (2025-10-28) used consistently across all documentation
- **Technical Depth**: Dual-mode behavior clearly explained, base class referenced, special cases documented (Poly CV gates-only)
- **Maintainability**: File paths relative to project root, proper markdown structure, code blocks with syntax highlighting

**No Issues Found:** Zero critical, high, medium, or low severity findings.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Not Applicable:** This is a documentation-only story. No code tests required.

**Verification Performed:**
- âœ… Manual review of all updated documentation files
- âœ… Cross-reference verification: Algorithm GUIDs match implementation files
- âœ… File path verification: All paths relative to project root and accurate
- âœ… Factory registration verification: Lines 309-340 in algorithm_routing.dart confirmed
- âœ… Implementation file existence: All 3 new routing files exist (clock_multiplier, clock_divider, poly updates)
- âœ… Test file existence: All 3 test files exist (clock_multiplier_es5_test.dart, clock_divider_es5_test.dart, poly_cv_es5_test.dart)

### Architectural Alignment

**Excellent Alignment:**

The documentation updates accurately reflect the established ES-5 architecture pattern:
- Base class pattern correctly described (Es5DirectOutputAlgorithmRouting)
- Dual-mode behavior explained (ES-5 Expander parameter controls routing)
- Factory registration pattern documented with correct line references
- Connection discovery via es5_direct bus marker mentioned
- Special case handling for Poly CV (gates-only ES-5) properly documented

The documentation follows project standards:
- Brownfield focus: Emphasizes existing patterns and how to extend
- AI agent context: Provides clear reference for future development
- Completeness: Links to implementation files, test files, base classes

### Security Notes

**Not Applicable:** Documentation-only changes pose no security risks.

### Best-Practices and References

**Documentation Best Practices Followed:**
- âœ… Consistent markdown formatting (proper headers ##, ###, code blocks with ```dart)
- âœ… Relative file paths from project root (no absolute paths)
- âœ… Cross-references between documents (architecture.md â†” CLAUDE.md â†” routing-system.md)
- âœ… Technical accuracy verified against implementation
- âœ… Completion date documented for historical tracking
- âœ… Known limitations documented (firmware 1.12+ requirement, Poly CV gate-only)

**References Verified:**
