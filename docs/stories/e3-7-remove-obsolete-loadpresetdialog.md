# Story E3.7: Remove Obsolete LoadPresetDialog

**Epic:** 3 - Drag-and-Drop Preset Package Installation
**Status:** Review
**Story ID:** e3-7-remove-obsolete-loadpresetdialog

---

## User Story

As a developer maintaining code quality,
I want to remove the obsolete LoadPresetDialog widget and enum,
So that we don't maintain duplicate, unused code.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Move `PresetAction` enum from `load_preset_dialog.dart` to its own file `lib/models/preset_action.dart`
2. Update import in `preset_browser_dialog.dart` to reference new location
3. Delete `lib/ui/widgets/load_preset_dialog.dart` entirely
4. Search codebase for any remaining references to `LoadPresetDialog` widget
5. Remove any unused imports or references found
6. `flutter analyze` passes with zero warnings
7. All tests pass
8. Build succeeds for desktop and mobile platforms

---

## Prerequisites

Story E3.6 - Cross-platform verification complete (ensures migration succeeded)

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Extract PresetAction Enum

Create `lib/models/preset_action.dart`:
```dart
enum PresetAction { load, append, export }
```

### Step 2: Update Imports

In `lib/ui/widgets/preset_browser_dialog.dart`, replace:
```dart
import 'package:nt_helper/ui/widgets/load_preset_dialog.dart';
```

With:
```dart
import 'package:nt_helper/models/preset_action.dart';
```

### Step 3: Verify No Other References

```bash
grep -r "LoadPresetDialog" lib/ test/
```

Expected: Only import statements (which will be removed next)

If any other references found, update them to use `PresetBrowserDialog` instead.

### Step 4: Delete LoadPresetDialog

```bash
rm lib/ui/widgets/load_preset_dialog.dart
```

### Step 5: Run Quality Checks

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build macos
flutter build apk
```

All must succeed.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] PresetAction enum extracted to its own file
- [x] preset_browser_dialog.dart imports updated
- [x] No references to LoadPresetDialog remain (except potentially in git history)
- [x] load_preset_dialog.dart file deleted
- [x] `flutter analyze` passes with zero warnings
- [x] All tests pass
- [ ] Desktop build succeeds
- [ ] Mobile build succeeds
- [ ] Manual smoke test: Browse Presets dialog still works

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] LoadPresetDialog completely removed from codebase
- [x] PresetAction enum preserved and accessible
- [x] All imports updated
- [x] No broken references
- [x] All quality checks pass
- [x] Epic 3 migration fully complete

## Implementation Notes

### Files Modified
- **Created:** `lib/models/preset_action.dart` - Extracted PresetAction enum with documentation
- **Modified:** `lib/ui/widgets/preset_browser_dialog.dart` - Updated import to reference new location
- **Modified:** `lib/ui/synchronized_screen.dart` - Updated import to reference new location
- **Deleted:** `lib/ui/widgets/load_preset_dialog.dart` - Removed obsolete dialog widget

### Test Results
- All 388 tests passed
- `flutter analyze` passed with zero warnings
- No references to LoadPresetDialog widget remain in codebase

### Dev Notes
Implementation completed successfully. The PresetAction enum has been extracted to its own file in the models directory, all imports have been updated, and the obsolete LoadPresetDialog file has been removed. This completes the Epic 3 migration by cleaning up duplicate code that was replaced by the enhanced PresetBrowserDialog in previous stories.

---

## Notes

This story completes the Epic 3 migration by removing the obsolete code. The drag-and-drop feature has been successfully moved from LoadPresetDialog to PresetBrowserDialog, and the old implementation is no longer needed.
