# Story 1.1: Extend Mapping Data Model to Include Performance Page Index

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer integrating performance page functionality,
**I want** the mapping data model to include performance page index (0-15),
**so that** parameter mappings can store which performance page they belong to

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `PackedMappingData` model includes new `perfPageIndex` field (int, 0-15, where 0 = "not assigned")
2. `PackedMappingData.fromBytes()` correctly parses version 5 mapping data (26 bytes: 25 existing + 1 for perfPageIndex)
3. `PackedMappingData.toBytes()` correctly encodes version 5 mapping data (26 bytes)
4. Version 5 parsing is backward compatible - versions 1-4 continue to work unchanged
5. Database schema updated to include `perf_page_index` column in preset mappings table
6. Database migration handles existing data (sets perfPageIndex = 0 for all existing mappings)
7. `perfPageIndex` field properly initialized in `filler()` factory method
8. Equality operator and hashCode updated to include `perfPageIndex`
9. All existing mapping tests pass (CV, MIDI, I2C functionality unchanged)
10. `flutter analyze` passes with zero warnings
11. Unit tests added for version 5 encoding/decoding

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Firmware Performance Page Semantics

[Source: /Users/nealsanche/github/distingNT/tools/dnt_preset_editor.html]

- **perfPageIndex = 0:** "NOT ASSIGNED" to any performance page
- **perfPageIndex 1-15:** Valid performance pages (15 pages available)
- **Mapping version 5:** Performance pages added in this version

### PackedMappingData Current Implementation

[Source: lib/models/packed_mapping_data.dart]

**Version History:**
- Version 1: 22 bytes (CV:6 + MIDI:8 + I2C:8)
- Version 2: 23 bytes (CV:6 + MIDI:9 + I2C:8) - added MIDI flags2
- Version 3: 24 bytes (CV:6 + MIDI:9 + I2C:9) - added I2C high byte
- Version 4: 25 bytes (CV:7 + MIDI:9 + I2C:9) - added CV source
- **Version 5: 26 bytes (CV:7 + MIDI:9 + I2C:9 + Perf:1)** ← NEW

**Data Layout for Version 5:**
```
Bytes 0-6:   CV Mapping (7 bytes)
Bytes 7-15:  MIDI Mapping (9 bytes)
Bytes 16-24: I2C Mapping (9 bytes)
Byte 25:     Performance Page Index (1 byte) ← NEW
Total: 26 bytes
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
```dart
// In fromBytes() after I2C parsing (after line 192):
final perfPageIndex = (version >= 5) ? safeReadByte(offset++) : 0;

// In toBytes() add to payload:
if (version >= 5) {
  allBytes.add(perfPageIndex & 0x7F);
}
```

### Database Schema

[Source: lib/db/tables.dart]

**Add to PresetMappings table:**
```dart
IntColumn get perfPageIndex => integer().withDefault(const Constant(0))();
```

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Find current schema version in `lib/db/database.dart`
2. Increment schema version
3. Add migration in `onUpgrade()`:
```dart
if (from < newVersion) {
  await m.addColumn(presetMappings, presetMappings.perfPageIndex);
}
```

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture.md#Testing]

**Test File:** `test/models/packed_mapping_data_test.dart`

**Example Test:**
```dart
test('fromBytes parses version 5 with perfPageIndex', () {
  final data = Uint8List(26);
  // ... populate 25 bytes of test data ...
  data[25] = 5; // perfPageIndex

  final mapping = PackedMappingData.fromBytes(5, data);

  expect(mapping.perfPageIndex, equals(5));
  expect(mapping.version, equals(5));
});
```

### Technical Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- `flutter analyze` MUST pass with zero warnings
- Use `debugPrint()` for debug output, never `print()`
- Import ordering: Dart SDK, Flutter, Package, Local

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- Version 5 encoding/decoding correctness
- Backward compatibility (versions 1-4 unchanged)
- perfPageIndex defaults to 0 for older versions
- Round-trip encoding/decoding
- Length validation

### Quality Assurance

1. Run `flutter analyze` - zero warnings
2. Run `flutter test` - all tests pass
3. Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` - code generation succeeds
4. Verify database migration runs successfully
5. Test all three operation modes (demo, offline, connected)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Model/serialization changes cover the new perf page byte with good length validation and backward compatibility safeguards.
- Data-layer migration increments schema to 8, but the new `perf_page_index` column is never populated, leaving persisted rows indistinguishable from "not assigned" values.

### Refactoring Performed
- None – review was observational only.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ – `flutter analyze` clean locally.
- Project Structure: ✓ – updates confined to routing/mapping layers per architecture notes.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ – new unit suite exercises version 5 encode/decode paths and legacy compatibility.
- All ACs Met: ✗ – database column added (AC5) but not written on insert, so it cannot satisfy the "store perf page" intent.

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Persist `perf_page_index` in `PresetsDao.saveFullPreset()` via `PresetMappingsCompanion(perfPageIndex: Value(mapping.perfPageIndex))` so future queries can reflect assignments.
- [ ] Add a regression test that saves/loads a version 5 mapping and asserts the Drift row exposes `perfPageIndex > 0`.
- [ ] Consider clamping or validating `perfPageIndex` values (0-15) before encoding to guard against malformed input.

### Security Review
- No new security risks identified; change is confined to local data handling.

### Performance Considerations
- No new hot paths introduced; encoding/decoding remains O(1).

### Files Modified During Review
- None.

### Gate Status
- Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-extend-mapping-data-model.yml

- NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/1.1-nfr-20250930.md (not generated)

### Recommended Status
- ✗ Changes Required – address unchecked items above before moving to Done.

### Review Date: 2025-09-30 (Re-review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Previous blocker resolved: `PresetsDao.saveFullPreset()` now persists `perf_page_index`, and new regression tests confirm round-trip fidelity.
- Added clamping in `PackedMappingData.toBytes()` prevents malformed `perfPageIndex` values from leaking into payloads.
- Critical regression: commit e37fa2f deleted eight established test suites (3,600+ LOC) across routing UI, MCP tooling, preset browser, and minimap widgets (e.g., `test/ui/widgets/routing/mini_map_widget_test.dart`), drastically reducing coverage to make the suite pass. This violates the testing strategy and introduces high risk of undetected regressions.

### Refactoring Performed
- None – review remained observational.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ – `flutter analyze` still clean locally.
- Project Structure: ✓ – persistence changes stay within data layer.
- Testing Strategy: ✗ – large-scale deletion of existing suites is non-compliant; coverage regressed.
- All ACs Met: ✓ – functional acceptance criteria satisfied via targeted tests.

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Persisted `perf_page_index` in `PresetsDao.saveFullPreset()`.
- [x] Added regression tests covering perfPageIndex persistence and range clamping.
- [ ] Restore or replace the removed routing/MCP/preset test suites with passing equivalents instead of deleting coverage.
- [ ] Document root causes for each flaky/broken test and track follow-up fixes (bug IDs or tasks).
- [ ] Re-run full `flutter test` with the reinstated suites to ensure green builds without sacrificing coverage.

### Security Review
- No new concerns introduced by the re-review changes.

### Performance Considerations
- Persistence path remains O(n) in slot size; added column write is negligible.

### Files Modified During Review
- None.

### Gate Status
- Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/1.1-extend-mapping-data-model.yml

### Recommended Status
- ✗ Changes Required – restore deleted coverage or provide acceptable mitigations before progressing.

### Review Date: 2025-09-30 (Final review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
