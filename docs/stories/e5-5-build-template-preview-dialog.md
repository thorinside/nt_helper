# Story 5.5: Build template preview dialog

Status: done

## Story

As a user about to inject a template,
I want to see a preview showing what algorithms will be added and where they'll go,
so that I can confirm the injection before modifying my current preset.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Preview dialog shows current preset summary: "Current: 5 algorithms (slots 1-5)"
2. Preview shows template algorithms that will be added: List of algorithm names from template
3. Preview shows result: "After injection: 8 algorithms (current 1-5 + template algorithms in slots 6-8)"
4. Dialog shows warning if injection would exceed 32 slots (and disables Inject button)
5. Dialog has "Cancel" and "Inject Template" buttons
6. "Inject Template" button triggers `injectTemplateToDevice()` method
7. Dialog shows loading spinner during injection
8. Dialog auto-closes on successful injection
9. Error message displayed in dialog if injection fails (stays open for user to read)
10. `flutter analyze` passes with zero warnings

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

- **Widget Type**: Stateful dialog widget with internal loading/error state
- **Dialog Pattern**: Use `showDialog()` with Material `AlertDialog` or custom dialog
- **State Management**: Local state for loading/error, observe `MetadataSyncCubit` for injection status
- **Async Handling**: Use `FutureBuilder` or manual state management for async injection

### Key Components

- `lib/ui/widgets/template_preview_dialog.dart` - New dialog widget
- `lib/ui/metadata_sync/metadata_sync_cubit.dart` - Injection service (from E5.4)
- `lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart` - Current preset state for slot count
- `lib/db/database.dart` - `FullPresetDetails` model for template data

### Dialog Structure

```dart
class TemplatePreviewDialog extends StatefulWidget {
  final FullPresetDetails template;
  final int currentSlotCount;
  final MetadataSyncCubit syncCubit;

  // ...
}
```

### UI Layout

1. **Header**: "Inject Template: [Template Name]"
2. **Current State Section**:
   - "Current Preset: X algorithms"
3. **Template Section**:
   - "Template: Y algorithms"
   - List of algorithm names (scrollable if many)
4. **Result Section**:
   - "After Injection: Z algorithms (slots A-B from current, C-D from template)"
5. **Warning Section** (if applicable):
   - Red warning icon and text if exceeds 32 slots
6. **Actions**:
   - Cancel button
   - Inject Template button (disabled if exceeds limit or loading)
7. **Loading State**:
   - Replace content with spinner and "Injecting..." text
8. **Error State**:
   - Show error message
   - Replace action buttons with "Close" button

### Testing Standards

- Widget tests for dialog rendering
- Widget tests for button states (enabled/disabled)
- Widget tests for loading and error states
- Integration tests for injection flow
- Manual testing with real hardware

### Project Structure Notes

- Follow Material Design dialog patterns
- Use existing color schemes and typography
- Ensure dialog is responsive to different screen sizes
- Support both light and dark themes
- Add semantic labels for accessibility

### Completion Notes List

Successfully implemented the TemplatePreviewDialog widget with all required functionality:

1. Created a stateful dialog widget that displays a detailed preview of template injection
2. Implemented comprehensive slot validation that prevents exceeding the 32-slot limit
3. Added multi-state UI handling: preview, loading, success (auto-close), and error states
4. Used PopScope (instead of deprecated WillPopScope) to prevent dialog dismissal during injection
5. Created full widget test suite with 19 tests covering all acceptance criteria
6. All tests pass (760 total, 19 skipped, 0 failures)
7. Flutter analyze passes with zero warnings

The dialog integrates seamlessly with the MetadataSyncCubit.injectTemplateToDevice() method from Story E5.4 and follows established patterns from preset_browser_dialog.dart.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Neal
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story E5.5 has been successfully implemented with excellent quality. The TemplatePreviewDialog widget provides a polished, user-friendly interface for template injection with proper validation, state management, and error handling. The implementation follows Flutter best practices, includes detailed test coverage (19 tests, all passing), and passes all static analysis checks. The code is production-ready.

### Key Findings

**High Quality Implementation:**
- Clean, well-structured stateful widget with clear separation of concerns
- Proper use of Material Design components and theming
- Excellent UI/UX with clear visual hierarchy and user feedback
- Modern Flutter patterns (PopScope instead of deprecated WillPopScope)

**Strong Test Coverage:**
- All 19 widget tests pass
- Tests cover all acceptance criteria comprehensively
- Good use of mocks and test utilities
- Edge cases properly tested (empty presets, exact 32-slot limit, etc.)

**No Critical Issues Found**

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

All 10 acceptance criteria fully satisfied:

1. ✅ **AC#1** - Preview dialog shows current preset summary correctly (verified in tests and code review)
2. ✅ **AC#2** - Template algorithms displayed in scrollable list with icons (lines 111-136)
3. ✅ **AC#3** - Result preview shows total and slot ranges (lines 140-162)
4. ✅ **AC#4** - Warning shown and button disabled when exceeding 32 slots (lines 166, 177, 245-275)
5. ✅ **AC#5** - Cancel and Inject Template buttons present (lines 172-180)
6. ✅ **AC#6** - Inject button triggers injectTemplateToDevice() (lines 277-333)
7. ✅ **AC#7** - Loading spinner shown during injection (lines 184-202)
8. ✅ **AC#8** - Dialog auto-closes on success (line 304)
9. ✅ **AC#9** - Error message displayed and dialog stays open (lines 204-233, 314-316)
10. ✅ **AC#10** - flutter analyze passes with zero warnings (verified)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Excellent Coverage:**
- Preview state rendering (7 tests)
- Slot limit validation (6 tests)
- Button actions (1 test)
- Loading state (2 tests)
- Error state (2 tests)
- Static show method (1 test)

**No Gaps Identified:**
All critical paths are tested. The test suite properly validates UI rendering, state transitions, and user interactions.

### Architectural Alignment

**Follows Project Standards:**
- Uses Cubit pattern for state management (MetadataSyncCubit)
- Stateful widget with local state for UI concerns (loading, error)
- Follows existing dialog patterns from preset_browser_dialog.dart
- Proper separation of concerns: UI logic in widget, business logic in cubit
- Uses PopScope for proper back navigation handling

**Material Design Compliance:**
- Proper use of AlertDialog
- Theme-aware color usage (colorScheme properties)
- Responsive sizing (60% of screen width)
- Accessibility considerations (semantic structure, icons with text)

### Security Notes

**No Security Concerns:**
- No sensitive data handling in this dialog
- No direct file system or network access
- Relies on MetadataSyncCubit for hardware communication
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

### Best-Practices and References

**Flutter Best Practices Followed:**
- StatefulWidget pattern for local state management
- Proper lifecycle management (mounted checks before setState)
- Theme-aware UI components
- Responsive design considerations
- Modern PopScope instead of deprecated WillPopScope

**Testing Best Practices:**
- Mock-based unit testing with mocktail
- Proper test organization with groups
- Test setup/teardown using setUp/setUpAll
- Fallback value registration for fakes
- Good test naming conventions
