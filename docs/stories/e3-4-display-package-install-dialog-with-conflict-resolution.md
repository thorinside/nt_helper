## User Story

As a user reviewing a dropped preset package,
I want to see the package contents, file conflicts, and choose which files to install,
So that I have full control over the installation process.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After conflict detection completes, handler shows `PackageInstallDialog` as modal
2. Dialog receives: `PackageAnalysis`, original package `Uint8List`, `DistingCubit` reference
3. Dialog displays package metadata: name, author, version, file count, conflict count
4. Dialog shows scrollable file list with conflict indicators (red text for conflicts)
5. Dialog provides bulk actions: "Overwrite All Conflicts", "Skip All Conflicts", "Install All"
6. Dialog provides per-file actions: Install, Skip, Overwrite (for conflicted files)
7. Install button enabled only when at least one file marked for installation
8. Cancel button dismisses dialog without installing
9. Dialog remains open until user clicks Install or Cancel
10. `flutter analyze` passes with zero warnings

---

## Prerequisites

Story E3.3 - Conflict detection complete

---

## Implementation Notes

**Reference:** `lib/ui/widgets/load_preset_dialog.dart` `_handleDragDone` (dialog section)

**Required Import:**
```dart
import 'package:nt_helper/ui/widgets/package_install_dialog.dart';
```

**Add to _handleDragDone (after conflict detection):**

```dart
if (!mounted) return;

// Show install dialog
await showDialog(
  context: context,
  barrierDismissible: false,
  builder: (context) => PackageInstallDialog(
    analysis: _currentAnalysis!,
    packageData: _currentPackageData!,
    distingCubit: widget.distingCubit,
    onInstall: () {
      Navigator.of(context).pop();
      // Refresh the preset browser listing
      context.read<PresetBrowserCubit>().loadRootDirectory();
      debugPrint('[PresetBrowserDialog] Package installed, refreshing listing');
    },
    onCancel: () {
      Navigator.of(context).pop();
      debugPrint('[PresetBrowserDialog] Package installation canceled');
    },
  ),
);

// Clear state after dialog closes
setState(() {
  _currentAnalysis = null;
  _currentPackageData = null;
});
```

**Note:** `PackageInstallDialog` is fully implemented and handles all installation logic internally (Story E3.5 verification).

**Testing:** Verify dialog shows package info, file list, conflict indicators, and action buttons.

## Dev Agent Record

### Debug Log
- Added import for `PackageInstallDialog` to `lib/ui/widgets/preset_browser_dialog.dart`
- State variables `_currentAnalysis` and `_currentPackageData` were already present from E3.3
- Removed `ignore: unused_field` comments since fields are now used
- Integrated `showDialog()` call in `_processPackageFile` after conflict detection completes
- Configured dialog with `barrierDismissible: false` to require user action
- Implemented `onInstall` callback to close dialog and refresh preset browser listing
- Implemented `onCancel` callback to close dialog without action
- Added state cleanup after dialog closes to prevent memory leaks
- Added tests to verify widget structure and import presence
- All tests pass (306 tests)
- `flutter analyze` passes with zero warnings

### Completion Notes
Story E3.4 successfully integrates the `PackageInstallDialog` into the drag-drop flow. The dialog displays after conflict detection completes, showing package metadata, file list with conflict indicators, and providing bulk/per-file actions for installation control. The implementation follows the exact pattern specified in the story notes, ensuring the preset browser listing refreshes after successful installation.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Neal
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story E3.4 successfully integrates the `PackageInstallDialog` into the `PresetBrowserDialog` drag-drop workflow. The implementation follows the established architectural patterns, correctly wires the dialog display after conflict detection, and provides proper callbacks for installation completion and cancellation. The code is clean, well-tested, and meets all acceptance criteria. The story represents a focused integration task that correctly delegates all installation logic to the existing `PackageInstallDialog` component.

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns: this story purely handles dialog integration, with all installation logic remaining in `PackageInstallDialog`
- Proper state management with `_currentAnalysis` and `_currentPackageData` variables that are cleaned up after dialog closes
- Correct callback implementation for both install and cancel paths
- Good error handling and debugging with `debugPrint` statements throughout
- Tests verify the integration points without testing implementation details
- Code follows Flutter best practices (mounted checks, proper setState usage)

**Minor Observations:**
- The implementation correctly uses `barrierDismissible: false` to force user action
- State cleanup in the finally block with mounted check prevents memory leaks
- The refresh callback `context.read<PresetBrowserCubit>().loadRootDirectory()` ensures UI consistency after installation

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Show dialog after conflict detection | ✅ Pass | `showDialog()` called immediately after `FileConflictDetector.detectConflicts()` at preset_browser_dialog.dart:420 |
| 2 | Dialog receives correct parameters | ✅ Pass | Passes `_currentAnalysis!`, `_currentPackageData!`, and `widget.distingCubit` at preset_browser_dialog.dart:424-426 |
| 3 | Display package metadata | ✅ Pass | Handled by `PackageInstallDialog._buildPackageInfo()` (verified by examining PackageInstallDialog) |
| 4 | Scrollable file list with conflicts | ✅ Pass | Handled by `PackageInstallDialog._buildFileList()` |
| 5 | Bulk actions provided | ✅ Pass | Handled by `PackageInstallDialog._buildActionButtons()` |
| 6 | Per-file actions provided | ✅ Pass | Handled by `PackageInstallDialog._buildFileItem()` |
| 7 | Install button enabled when selection valid | ✅ Pass | Handled by PackageInstallDialog's internal state management |
| 8 | Cancel button dismisses dialog | ✅ Pass | `onCancel` callback calls `Navigator.of(context).pop()` at preset_browser_dialog.dart:434 |
| 9 | Dialog remains open until action | ✅ Pass | `barrierDismissible: false` at preset_browser_dialog.dart:422 |
| 10 | `flutter analyze` passes | ✅ Pass | Verified - zero warnings reported |

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Existing Coverage:**
- Widget structure tests verify dialog can be built
- Import presence verified by compilation success
- State variable existence confirmed by widget builds

**Test Gaps (Acceptable for this story):**
The tests are appropriately minimal for an integration story. Full end-to-end testing of the dialog behavior is appropriately left to the PackageInstallDialog's own test suite. The integration tests verify:
1. The widget builds without errors (proving imports and state structure are correct)
2. Basic widget hierarchy exists

**Recommendation:** Consider adding an integration test in a future story that mocks the drop operation and verifies the dialog is shown with correct parameters. However, this is not a blocker for the current story.

### Architectural Alignment

**Adherence to Patterns:**
- ✅ Follows established drag-drop pattern from `gallery_screen.dart` and `load_preset_dialog.dart`
- ✅ Uses platform-conditional DropTarget wrapping (E3.1 pattern)
- ✅ Proper state management through setState
- ✅ Correct Cubit access via `widget.distingCubit` and `context.read<PresetBrowserCubit>()`
- ✅ Consistent use of `debugPrint()` over `print()`
- ✅ Proper async/await handling with mounted checks

**Integration Points:**
- `FileConflictDetector` correctly instantiated and used
- `DistingCubit` properly passed through constructor
- `PresetBrowserCubit` accessed through context for refresh operation
- State cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Security Notes

**No Security Issues Identified**

The implementation correctly:
- Validates packages before showing installation dialog (validation happens in E3.2)
- Delegates file writing to `DistingCubit` which handles proper sanitization
- Uses typed parameters (no string injection risks)
- Properly scopes dialog context

### Best-Practices and References

**Flutter Best Practices:**
- ✅ Uses `const` constructors where appropriate
- ✅ Proper StatefulWidget lifecycle management
- ✅ Async operations protected by mounted checks
- ✅ Material Design patterns followed
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch-finally

**Package-Specific Patterns:**
- Follows nt_helper's debug logging conventions
- Matches existing dialog integration patterns
- Consistent with codebase's state management approach using Cubit

### Action Items

None. The implementation is production-ready and meets all requirements.
