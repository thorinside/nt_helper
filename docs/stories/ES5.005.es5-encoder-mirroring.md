# Story ES5.005: ES-5 Encoder Mirroring

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** user of the ES-5 Encoder algorithm,
**I want** to see how my enabled input channels mirror to ES-5 outputs,
**so that** I understand the signal flow from internal buses through the encoder to the physical ES-5 outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each enabled ES-5 Encoder input channel generates a corresponding output port
2. Output ports connect to the matching ES-5 numbered port (channel 1 → es5_1, etc.)
3. Disabled channels create no output ports or connections
4. Visual flow shows: Input Bus → ES-5 Encoder → ES-5 Port
5. Output ports are named "To ES-5 X" where X is the channel number
6. Connections use appropriate type and metadata for discovery

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Modify ES-5 Encoder Output Generation (AC: 1, 3, 5)
  - [x] Open lib/core/routing/es5_encoder_algorithm_routing.dart
  - [x] Override generateOutputPorts() method

  - [x] Set port ID format: '${algorithmUuid}_channel_${channelNumber}_output'
  - [x] Set port name: 'To ES-5 $channelNumber'
  - [x] Set type: PortType.gate
  - [x] Set direction: PortDirection.output
  - [x] Store channel number in port for connection mapping
  - [x] Add debug logging for each created output

- [x] Add ES-5 Encoder Connection Discovery (AC: 2, 4, 6)
  - [x] Modify connection_discovery_service.dart
  - [x] In discoverConnections method, check for ES5EncoderAlgorithmRouting
  - [x] Create new _createEs5EncoderConnections method
  - [x] For each output with busParam='es5_encoder_mirror'
  - [x] Create connection to es5_${channelNumber} port
  - [x] Set connectionType to ConnectionType.algorithmToAlgorithm

  - [x] Test with selective channels enabled (e.g., 1, 3, 5 only)
  - [x] Test with all channels disabled
  - [x] Verify visual flow in routing editor

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `lib/core/routing/es5_encoder_algorithm_routing.dart` - Main file to modify
- `lib/core/routing/connection_discovery_service.dart` - Add connection logic
- ES-5 Encoder already generates input ports for enabled channels only

### Key Implementation Details
Output Port Generation:
```dart
@override
List<Port> generateOutputPorts() {
  final ports = <Port>[];

  // inputPorts already contains only enabled channels
  for (final inputPort in inputPorts) {
    // Input ID format: '${algorithmUuid}_channel_${channelNumber}_input'
    final channelMatch = RegExp(r'channel_(\d+)_input').firstMatch(inputPort.id);

    if (channelMatch != null) {
      final channelNumber = int.parse(channelMatch.group(1)!);

      ports.add(Port(
        id: '${algorithmUuid ?? 'es5e'}_channel_${channelNumber}_output',
        name: 'To ES-5 $channelNumber',
        type: PortType.gate,
        direction: PortDirection.output,
        description: 'Mirror to ES-5 Output $channelNumber',
        channelNumber: channelNumber,
        busParam: 'es5_encoder_mirror', // Special marker
      ));
    }
  }

  return ports;
}
```

Connection Discovery:
```dart
static List<Connection> _createEs5EncoderConnections(
  ES5EncoderAlgorithmRouting routing,
) {
  final connections = <Connection>[];

  for (final outputPort in routing.outputPorts) {
    if (outputPort.busParam == 'es5_encoder_mirror' &&
        outputPort.channelNumber != null) {

      final es5PortId = 'es5_${outputPort.channelNumber}';

      connections.add(
        Connection(
          id: 'conn_${outputPort.id}_to_$es5PortId',
          sourcePortId: outputPort.id,
          destinationPortId: es5PortId,
          connectionType: ConnectionType.algorithmToAlgorithm,
          algorithmId: routing.algorithmUuid ?? 'es5e',
          signalType: SignalType.gate,
          description: 'ES-5 Encoder mirror connection',
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  return connections;
}
```

Mirror Behavior:
- ES-5 Encoder has 8 channels that can be individually enabled/disabled
- Each enabled input creates a "virtual" output that connects to ES-5
- This creates the visual flow: Bus → Encoder Input → Encoder Output → ES-5 Port
- Disabled channels should have no presence in the routing

### Testing Standards
- Unit test output port generation with various enable patterns
- Test connection creation for all 8 channels
- Integration test with actual ES-5 Encoder preset
- Verify visual flow is clear and intuitive

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Exceptional implementation demonstrating exemplary software engineering practices. The ES-5 Encoder mirroring feature is production-ready with full test coverage, strong architecture adherence, and zero analyzer warnings. All 6 acceptance criteria are thoroughly implemented and tested with comprehensive unit tests.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `lib/core/routing/es5_encoder_algorithm_routing.dart`
  - **Change**: Extracted magic strings to static constants
  - **Why**: Improve maintainability and eliminate duplication
  - **How**: Created `mirrorBusParam`, `defaultAlgorithmUuid`, and `channelIdPattern` constants for reuse

- **File**: `lib/core/routing/connection_discovery_service.dart`
  - **Change**: Updated to reference extracted constants
  - **Why**: Consistency and single source of truth
  - **How**: References `ES5EncoderAlgorithmRouting` constants instead of hardcoded strings

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows all project patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper routing framework integration
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Full unit test coverage (7 tests, all passing)
- All ACs Met: ✓ Each AC has corresponding test verification

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Extracted magic strings to constants for better maintainability

- [ ] Consider helper method for port ID generation in base class

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Pure data transformation logic with no external input, network, or file operations.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues. Implementation is highly efficient:
- O(n) complexity where n = max 8 channels
