# Story ES5.004: USB From Host ES-5 Connections

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** user of USB From Host with Silent Way software,
**I want** to see connections from USB channels to ES-5 L/R ports,
**so that** I understand how my Silent Way audio signals are routed to the ES-5 expander for gate generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. USB From Host channels with bus 29 connect to es5_L port
2. USB From Host channels with bus 30 connect to es5_R port
3. Connections are visible as lines in the routing editor
4. Connections use ConnectionType.hardwareOutput type
5. Signal type is set to audio for ES-5 L/R connections
6. Existing non-ES-5 USB routing continues to work unchanged

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Modify Hardware Output Connection Logic (AC: 1, 2, 4, 5)
  - [x] Open lib/core/routing/connection_discovery_service.dart
  - [x] Locate _createHardwareOutputConnections method
  - [x] Add check for BusSpec.isEs5(busNumber) before standard hardware logic
  - [x] Map bus 29 to port ID 'es5_L'
  - [x] Map bus 30 to port ID 'es5_R'

  - [x] For each output assignment to ES-5 bus
  - [x] Create Connection object with proper fields
  - [x] Set connectionType to ConnectionType.hardwareOutput
  - [x] Include all required metadata (algorithmId, parameterNumber, etc.)
  - [x] Add debug logging for ES-5 connection creation

- [x] Verify USB From Host Support (AC: 6)
  - [x] Check usb_from_algorithm_routing.dart
  - [x] Confirm extractIOParameters supports max value 30
  - [x] Confirm generateOutputPorts handles buses 29-30
  - [x] Document that no changes needed (already supports ES-5)

- [x] Test Connection Discovery (AC: 1-6)
  - [x] Create test case with USB From Host using bus 29
  - [x] Create test case with USB From Host using bus 30
  - [x] Verify connections are created correctly
  - [x] Test mixed USB outputs (some ES-5, some standard)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `lib/core/routing/connection_discovery_service.dart` - Main file to modify
- `lib/core/routing/usb_from_algorithm_routing.dart` - Already supports ES-5 buses
- `lib/core/routing/bus_spec.dart` - Contains isEs5() method
- `test/core/routing/es5_bus_values_test.dart` - Existing ES-5 tests

### Key Implementation Details
Connection Discovery Modification:
```dart
static List<Connection> _createHardwareOutputConnections(
  int busNumber,
  List<_PortAssignment> outputs,
) {
  final connections = <Connection>[];

  // NEW: Check for ES-5 buses first
  if (BusSpec.isEs5(busNumber)) {
    final es5PortId = busNumber == 29 ? 'es5_L' : 'es5_R';

    for (final output in outputs) {
      connections.add(
        Connection(
          id: 'conn_${output.portId}_to_$es5PortId',
          sourcePortId: output.portId,
          destinationPortId: es5PortId,
          connectionType: ConnectionType.hardwareOutput,
          busNumber: busNumber,
          algorithmId: output.algorithmId,
          algorithmIndex: output.algorithmIndex,
          parameterNumber: output.parameterNumber,
          signalType: SignalType.audio, // ES-5 L/R are audio
          isOutput: true,
          outputMode: output.outputMode,
        ),
      );
    }
    return connections;
  }

  // EXISTING: Standard hardware output logic
  // ...
}
```

Existing USB From Host Support:
- Per test files, USB From Host already handles buses 29-30
- UsbFromAlgorithmRouting.extractIOParameters supports max=30
- Only connection discovery needs modification

ES-5 Bus Mapping:
- Bus 29 → es5_L (Silent Way Left channel)
- Bus 30 → es5_R (Silent Way Right channel)
- These are audio signals that Silent Way encodes with gate information

### Testing Standards
- Unit test in test/core/routing/connection_discovery_service_test.dart
- Test cases for bus 29 → es5_L and bus 30 → es5_R
- Integration test with actual USB From Host preset
- Verify no regression in standard output routing (buses 13-20)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation that cleanly extends the existing connection discovery logic to support ES-5 hardware connections. The solution is minimal, non-intrusive, and follows established patterns perfectly. The ES-5 detection is appropriately placed before standard hardware output logic, ensuring proper routing precedence.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring necessary - the implementation is already clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All `debugPrint()` statements used correctly, no `print()` calls
- Project Structure: ✓ Logic correctly placed in connection_discovery_service.dart
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with full AC coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

All items already handled by the developer:
- [x] ES-5 detection logic implemented correctly
- [x] Proper signal type (audio) set for ES-5 connections
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage added
- [x] Debug logging included for troubleshooting
- [x] No impact on existing routing logic

No additional improvements needed.

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This is purely routing visualization logic with no external inputs or sensitive data handling.

### Performance Considerations

Minimal performance impact. The ES-5 check is a simple integer comparison that occurs before the existing hardware output logic, adding negligible overhead.

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during review - implementation was already optimal.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/ES5.004-usb-from-host-connections.yml

### Test Coverage Mapping

| AC | Test Coverage | Status |
|----|--------------|--------|
| 1. USB bus 29 → es5_L | "ES-5 bus 29 creates connection to es5_L port" | ✓ |
| 2. USB bus 30 → es5_R | "ES-5 bus 30 creates connection to es5_R port" | ✓ |
| 3. Visible connections | Connection objects created and returned | ✓ |
| 4. ConnectionType.hardwareOutput | All tests verify correct type | ✓ |
| 5. SignalType.audio | Tests verify audio signal type | ✓ |
| 6. No regression | "ES-5 connections do not affect standard output routing" | ✓ |

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met, comprehensive test coverage, zero analyzer warnings, and clean implementation following established patterns.
