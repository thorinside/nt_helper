# Story 2.3: Extract and Stream Raw Frames via EventChannel

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** musician using nt_helper on Android,
**I want** the app to extract video frames from the UVC camera and stream them to the UI,
**so that** I can see my Disting NT display updating in real-time on my Android device.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. **Frame Format Conversion**
   - Convert extracted frames to BMP or PNG format
   - Match format used by iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux (BMP preferred for performance)
   - Frame bytes encoded correctly for EventChannel transmission
   - Maintain Disting NT resolution (256x64)

3. **EventChannel Streaming**
   - Stream frame bytes via `_frameStreamController` to Flutter

### Relevant Source Tree

**Primary Files:**
- `lib/services/platform_channels/android_usb_video_channel.dart` - Implement frame extraction and streaming
- `lib/cubit/video_frame_cubit.dart` - Frame consumer (no changes needed)
- `lib/ui/widgets/floating_video_overlay.dart` - Display widget (no changes needed)

**Reference Implementations:**
- **iOS BMP encoding:** `ios/Runner/UsbVideoCapturePlugin.swift` lines 305-411
- **macOS PNG encoding:** `macos/Runner/UsbVideoCapturePlugin.swift` lines 330-335
- **Windows:** Check `windows/runner/usb_video_capture_plugin.cpp` for format

**iOS BMP Encoding Pattern (Reference):**
```swift
// From ios/Runner/UsbVideoCapturePlugin.swift:306-411
func encodeBMP(from cgImage: CGImage) -> Data? {
    let width = cgImage.width
    let height = cgImage.height
    let bytesPerPixel = 3
    let rowPadding = (4 - ((width * bytesPerPixel) % 4)) % 4
    let dataSize = (width * bytesPerPixel + rowPadding) * height

    // Create BMP header (54 bytes)
    // File header: 'BM', file size, reserved, offset
    // DIB header: size, width, -height (top-down), planes, bpp, compression...

    // Convert CGImage pixels to BGR format with row padding
    // Return complete BMP file bytes
}
```

**Dart BMP Encoding Approach:**
```dart
Uint8List encodeBMP(/* frame data */) {
  final width = 256;
  final height = 64;
  final bytesPerPixel = 3; // RGB
  final rowPadding = (4 - ((width * bytesPerPixel) % 4)) % 4;
  final dataSize = (width * bytesPerPixel + rowPadding) * height;
  final fileSize = 54 + dataSize; // 54 byte header + pixel data

  final bmpData = Uint8List(fileSize);

  // Write BMP file header (14 bytes)
  bmpData[0] = 0x42; bmpData[1] = 0x4D; // 'BM'
  _writeUint32LE(bmpData, 2, fileSize);
  _writeUint32LE(bmpData, 10, 54); // Offset to pixel data

  // Write DIB header (40 bytes)
  _writeUint32LE(bmpData, 14, 40); // Header size
  _writeUint32LE(bmpData, 18, width);
  _writeInt32LE(bmpData, 22, -height); // Negative = top-down
  _writeUint16LE(bmpData, 26, 1); // Planes
  _writeUint16LE(bmpData, 28, 24); // Bits per pixel
  // Compression and other fields = 0

  // Write pixel data (BGR format with padding)
  // ... convert RGB to BGR and add row padding

  return bmpData;
}
```

### Frame Extraction Strategy Research

**Challenge:** UVCCamera uses texture-based rendering for preview, but EventChannel needs raw bytes.

**Option 1: Platform Channel for Frame Callback (Recommended)**
- Add native Android method to intercept frames before texture rendering
- UVCCamera native code likely has frame callback in C++ layer
- Expose via platform channel to get raw frame bytes
- Pros: Direct access to raw frames, best performance
- Cons: Requires native Android code, more complex

**Option 2: Texture Readback**
- Use Flutter's texture rendering then read pixels back
- May use `Scene.toImage()` or similar Flutter APIs
- Pros: Pure Dart solution
- Cons: Performance overhead, GPU→CPU transfer

**Option 3: Video Recording Stream Interception**
- UVCameraController has `startVideoRecording()` method
- Intercept video encoding stream for raw frames
- Pros: Uses existing API
- Cons: High overhead, not designed for streaming

**Investigation Tasks:**
1. Check UVCCamera platform interface for frame callback support
2. Review UVCCamera Android native code for frame access points
3. Test texture readback performance on target device
4. Document chosen approach and fallback plan

**Reference from UVCCamera Source:**
- Check `~/.pub-cache/git/UVCCamera-*/flutter/android/` for native implementation
- Look for frame callback or preview callback in Java/Kotlin code
- Check platform channel method handlers for frame access

### Technical Debt

**Identified:**
1. **BMP Encoding Unit Tests:** Current tests validate stream integration, but encodeBMP() logic untested
   - Priority: Medium
   - Owner: Dev
   - Suggested: Add unit tests for encodeBMP() with mock pixel data
   - Effort: 2-3 hours

2. **Real Camera Integration:** Current implementation uses synthetic test frames
   - Priority: High (Story 2.4 responsibility)
   - Owner: Dev
   - Suggested: Connect real UVCCamera frame callbacks (platform channel approach from research)
   - Effort: 4-6 hours

3. **Manual Testing Documentation:** AC4 performance targets need runtime validation
   - Priority: Medium
   - Owner: QA/Dev
   - Suggested: Create test checklist with performance benchmarks, visual quality checks
   - Effort: 1-2 hours

### Gate Status
