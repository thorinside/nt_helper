# Story ES5.003: Add Conditional Display Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user working with ES-5 expander,
**I want** to see the ES-5 node only when relevant algorithms are present,
**so that** the routing view remains clean and only shows hardware that is actually being used.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ES-5 node appears when preset contains algorithms with GUIDs: usbf, clck, eucp, or es5e
2. ES-5 node is hidden when no ES-5 capable algorithms are present
3. ES-5 node is positioned after Physical Outputs in the layout
4. Visual styling matches existing Physical Inputs/Outputs hardware nodes
5. State management properly tracks ES-5 node visibility

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `lib/cubit/routing_editor_cubit.dart` - State management for routing editor
- `lib/ui/widgets/routing/routing_editor_widget.dart` - UI rendering
- `lib/core/routing/models/es5_hardware_node.dart` - ES-5 node from Story ES5-002
- `lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart` - Source of slots and algorithm data

### Key Implementation Details
Algorithm GUID Detection:
- Access slots via: `_distingCubit.state.slots`
- Algorithm GUID location: `slot.algorithm.guid`
- ES-5 capable algorithms: USB From Host (usbf), Clock (clck), Euclidean (eucp), ES-5 Encoder (es5e)

State Structure:
- Routing state contains hardware nodes list
- Each hardware node has: id, name, type, ports, position
- ES-5 node should be added to this list when needed

Positioning Logic (from Story ES5-001):
- Hardware nodes are positioned in sequence
- Physical Inputs → Algorithm nodes → Physical Outputs → ES-5
- Use consistent spacing between nodes
- Position stored as x,y coordinates in state

Widget Pattern:
```dart
// In build method
if (state.hasEs5Node) {
  _buildEs5Node(state.es5Node),
}

// Build method
Widget _buildEs5Node(Es5NodeState nodeState) {
  return HardwareNodeWidget(
    title: 'ES-5 Expander',
    icon: Icons.memory,
    ports: nodeState.ports,
    position: nodeState.position,
    // Copy styling from Physical nodes
  );
}
```

### Testing Standards
- Unit test shouldShowEs5Node() logic with various algorithm combinations
- Integration test ES-5 node visibility with preset changes
- Manual test for visual consistency and smooth transitions
- Verify no console errors or warnings during show/hide

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented conditional ES-5 node display in the routing editor. The ES-5 expander node now appears only when the preset contains ES-5 capable algorithms (usbf, clck, eucp, es5e) and is hidden otherwise. The implementation follows the existing pattern for physical hardware nodes.

### Key Changes
1. **Detection Logic**: Added `shouldShowEs5Node()` method to RoutingEditorCubit that checks for ES-5 capable algorithm GUIDs
2. **State Management**: Extended RoutingEditorState.loaded to include es5Inputs field (conditionally populated)
3. **Widget Creation**: Created ES5Node widget following the same pattern as PhysicalInputNode and PhysicalOutputNode
4. **UI Integration**: Added conditional rendering in routing_editor_widget.dart after Physical Outputs node

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality. The story demonstrates strong adherence to project patterns, thorough testing of business logic, and clean code structure. The conditional ES-5 node display feature is well-architected with proper separation of concerns: detection logic in `RoutingEditorCubit`, state management via freezed patterns, and rendering via reusable widgets.

All acceptance criteria are fully met with appropriate test coverage for business logic and manual verification for visual aspects. The implementation follows the established pattern for hardware nodes, reusing `ES5HardwareNode` from Story ES5.002 and leveraging the same `MovablePhysicalIONode` widget used by Physical Inputs/Outputs.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The code is already well-structured and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

  - Null safety properly implemented
- Project Structure: ✓ Files organized correctly
  - Core models: lib/core/routing/models/es5_hardware_node.dart
  - State management: lib/cubit/routing_editor_cubit.dart, routing_editor_state.dart

**AC1**: ES-5 node appears when preset contains algorithms with GUIDs (usbf, clck, eucp, es5e)
- **Tests**: Tests 1-4, 6-7 in routing_editor_cubit_es5_test.dart
- **Given** preset contains ES-5 capable algorithm (usbf/clck/eucp/es5e)
- **When** RoutingEditorCubit processes synchronized state
- **Then** shouldShowEs5Node() returns true and es5Inputs is populated

**AC2**: ES-5 node is hidden when no ES-5 capable algorithms are present
- **Tests**: Tests 5, 8 in routing_editor_cubit_es5_test.dart
- **Given** preset contains no ES-5 capable algorithms

- **Then** shouldShowEs5Node() returns false and es5Inputs is empty list

**AC3**: ES-5 node is positioned after Physical Outputs in the layout
- **Implementation**: Build order confirmed in routing_editor_widget.dart:1068-1089
- **Given** ES-5 inputs are present in state
- **When** RoutingEditorWidget builds node stack
- **Then** ES-5 nodes render after Physical Output nodes

**AC4**: Visual styling matches existing Physical Inputs/Outputs hardware nodes
- **Implementation**: ES5Node widget uses MovablePhysicalIONode (es5_node.dart:82)
- **Given** ES-5 node is rendered
- **When** styled with MovablePhysicalIONode pattern
- **Then** visual appearance matches Physical Input/Output nodes

**AC5**: State management properly tracks ES-5 node visibility
- **Implementation**: es5Inputs field in RoutingEditorState.loaded (routing_editor_state.dart:74)
- **Given** algorithm composition changes
- **When** _processSynchronizedState executes (routing_editor_cubit.dart:148-150)
- **Then** es5Inputs field reflects current ES-5 node visibility

**AC6**: No visual glitches or layout shifts when node appears/disappears
- **Implementation**: Conditional rendering via state reactivity (routing_editor_widget.dart:1079-1084)
- **Given** ES-5 visibility state changes
- **When** widget rebuilds with new state
- **Then** smooth transition occurs via Flutter's standard rebuild mechanism

### Improvements Checklist

All items completed by development team:
- [x] ES-5 detection logic implemented with efficient Set-based GUID checking
- [x] State management extended with es5Inputs field
- [x] ES5Node widget created following established patterns
- [x] Conditional rendering integrated into routing editor
- [x] Unit tests covering all detection scenarios (8/8 passing)

### Security Review

**Status**: PASS

No security concerns identified. This feature implements UI display logic for conditional node visibility with no authentication, authorization, data persistence, or external API interactions. The implementation is purely client-side visual logic driven by algorithm configuration data.

### Performance Considerations

**Status**: PASS

Efficient implementation with optimal performance characteristics:
- Detection logic is O(n) where n = number of slots (max 8 in Disting NT)
- GUID checking uses Set.contains() which is O(1)
- Conditional node creation prevents unnecessary widget instantiation when ES-5 is not needed
- State changes trigger rebuilds following Flutter's standard reactive pattern
- No performance bottlenecks identified
