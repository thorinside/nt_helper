# Story ES5I.1: USB From Host ES-5 Direct Routing

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Disting NT user configuring USB audio routing,
**I want** to drag connections from USB From Host outputs directly to ES-5 L/R inputs in the routing editor,
**so that** I can route USB audio to ES-5 expander outputs without switching to the parameter page.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **ES-5 L/R inputs are visible as drop targets** when dragging from USB From Host algorithm output ports in the routing editor
2. **Dragging a connection from USB output to ES-5 L** automatically sets the USB channel's bus parameter value to 29
3. **Dragging a connection from USB output to ES-5 R** automatically sets the USB channel's bus parameter value to 30
4. **Visual connection is created** showing the USB output connected to the ES-5 L or R input
5. **Deleting the connection** resets the USB channel's bus parameter value to 0 (None)
6. **Parameter page reflects changes** - when ES-5 routing is set via drag-and-drop, the parameter page immediately shows the updated bus value (29 or 30)
7. **Routing editor reflects parameter page changes** - when bus value is changed on parameter page to 29 or 30, the routing editor shows the connection to ES-5 L or R

### Integration Requirements

8. **Existing USB From Host routing** to normal outputs (buses 1-28) continues to work unchanged
9. **Existing drag-and-drop connection flows** for other algorithms remain functional
10. **Connection discovery system** correctly identifies ES-5 L/R connections alongside existing connections
11. **No changes to core AlgorithmRouting interfaces** - all changes are additive

### Quality Requirements

12. **`flutter analyze` passes** with zero warnings
13. **Existing routing functionality regression tested** - verify USB routing to normal buses, connection creation/deletion, parameter sync
14. **Bidirectional parameter sync tested** - verify routing editor ↔ parameter page sync works for ES-5 L/R values

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

**Routing Editor Architecture:**
- **Source of Truth**: `DistingCubit` (`lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart`) exposes synchronized `Slot`s containing algorithm + parameters + values
- **OO Framework**: `lib/core/routing/` contains all routing logic
  - `AlgorithmRouting.fromSlot()` factory creates routing instances from live Slot data
  - `UsbFromAlgorithmRouting` handles USB From Host algorithm (supports bus values 0-30)
  - `ConnectionDiscoveryService` discovers connections via bus assignments
- **State Management**: `RoutingEditorCubit` (`lib/cubit/routing_editor_cubit.dart`) orchestrates the framework, stores computed state
- **Visualization**: `RoutingEditorWidget` (`lib/ui/widgets/routing/routing_editor_widget.dart`) displays pre-computed data and handles drag-and-drop

**USB From Host Algorithm:**
- **File**: `lib/core/routing/usb_from_algorithm_routing.dart`
- **GUID**: `usbf`
- **Channels**: 8 USB audio channels (1-8)
- **Parameters**: Each channel has a "to" parameter (bus routing) and a "mode" parameter (Add/Replace)
- **Bus Values**: 0 = None, 1-12 = Inputs, 13-20 = Outputs O1-O8, 29 = ES-5 L, 30 = ES-5 R
- **Port Structure**:
  - No input ports (USB from host)
  - 8 output ports representing USB channels 1-8
  - Each port has `busValue`, `busParam`, `parameterNumber`, `channelNumber`, `modeParameterNumber`

**ES-5 Node:**
- **File**: `lib/ui/widgets/routing/es5_node.dart`
- **Current Function**: Visualizes ES-5 expander with 8 output ports
- **Needed Addition**: Create input ports for ES-5 L (bus 29) and ES-5 R (bus 30)

**Connection Creation Flow:**
1. User drags from source port to target port
2. `RoutingEditorWidget._handleConnectionCreated()` is called
3. Widget calls `onConnectionCreated` callback
4. Callback updates parameter via `DistingCubit.updateParameterValue()`
5. `DistingCubit` emits new state with updated parameter
6. `RoutingEditorCubit` reacts to state change and recomputes routing
7. Widget rebuilds with updated connections

**Parameter Update Pattern:**
```dart
// Update parameter via DistingCubit
await distingCubit.updateParameterValue(
  algorithmIndex: slotIndex,
  parameterNumber: port.parameterNumber,
  value: newBusValue, // 29 for ES-5 L, 30 for ES-5 R
);
```

**Key Integration Points:**
- `es5_node.dart`: Add L/R input ports for connection targets
- `UsbFromAlgorithmRouting`: Already supports bus values 29-30 (no changes needed to routing class)
- `RoutingEditorWidget`: Handle USB → ES-5 connection creation/deletion
- `RoutingEditorCubit`: Ensure state updates when parameters change
