# Story ES5.002: Create ES-5 Hardware Node Model

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer implementing ES-5 visualization,
**I want** to create the ES-5 hardware node model with proper port configuration,
**so that** the routing editor can display ES-5 connections with the correct port structure and types.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ES-5 node class created following the exact pattern discovered in Story ES5-001
2. Exactly 10 input ports are created with correct types (L/R as audio, 1-8 as gate)
3. Port IDs follow the convention: es5_L, es5_R, es5_1 through es5_8
4. L port has busValue=29, R port has busValue=30, numbered ports have no fixed busValue
5. Class compiles with zero flutter analyze warnings
6. Node properties (id, name, type) are properly defined

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create ES-5 Hardware Node Class (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Create new file lib/core/routing/models/es5_hardware_node.dart
  - [x] Add documentation header from Story ES5-001 findings
  - [x] Import required dependencies (flutter/foundation.dart, port.dart)
  - [x] Define class properties: id='es5_hardware_node', name='ES-5', type='es5_expander'

- [x] Implement Port Creation Methods (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Implement createInputPorts() method
  - [x] Create L port: id='es5_L', type=PortType.audio, busValue=29
  - [x] Create R port: id='es5_R', type=PortType.audio, busValue=30
  - [x] Create ports 1-8: id='es5_$i', type=PortType.gate, no busValue
  - [x] Add debug logging for port creation

- [x] Implement Empty Output Ports Method (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create createOutputPorts() returning empty list
  - [x] Document that ES-5 is a sink (no outputs)

- [x] Validate Implementation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Run flutter analyze and fix any warnings
  - [x] Verify all 10 ports are created correctly
  - [x] Test that class can be instantiated without errors

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `lib/core/routing/models/` - Location for new es5_hardware_node.dart file
- `lib/core/routing/models/port.dart` - Port class to use for port creation
- Pattern follows Physical Inputs/Outputs from `lib/ui/widgets/routing/routing_editor_widget.dart`

### Key Implementation Details
From Story ES5-001 research:
- Port class constructor takes: id, name, type, direction, description, busValue (optional)
- PortType enum has: audio, cv, gate, clock
- PortDirection enum has: input, output
- Hardware nodes typically have either all inputs or all outputs
- ES-5 L/R are for Silent Way audio encoding (must be audio type)
- ES-5 1-8 are for gate/trigger signals (must be gate type)

### Port Configuration Requirements
```dart
// L channel port
Port(
  id: 'es5_L',
  name: 'L',
  type: PortType.audio,
  direction: PortDirection.input,
  description: 'ES-5 Left (Silent Way)',
  busValue: 29,
)

// Numbered ports (1-8)
Port(
  id: 'es5_$i',
  name: '$i',
  type: PortType.gate,
  direction: PortDirection.input,
  description: 'ES-5 Output $i',
  // No busValue - dynamic based on algorithm
)
```

### Testing Standards
- Must compile without errors
- flutter analyze must show zero warnings
- Unit test file location: test/core/routing/models/es5_hardware_node_test.dart
- Test that exactly 10 ports are created
- Test port types and bus values are correct

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Debug Log References
N/A - No debugging required, implementation straightforward

### Completion Notes
- Created ES5HardwareNode utility class following PhysicalPortGenerator pattern
- Implemented createInputPorts() generating exactly 10 ports (L, R, 1-8)
- Implemented createOutputPorts() returning empty list (ES-5 is sink device)
- Added helper methods: isES5Port(), getLeftAudioPort(), getRightAudioPort(), getNumberedPort()
- Created unit tests with 27 test cases covering all functionality
- All tests passed, flutter analyze shows zero warnings
- Port configuration matches ES5.002 specification exactly:
  - L port: audio type, busValue=29
  - R port: audio type, busValue=30
  - Ports 1-8: gate type, no busValue
- All ports use PortDirection.input (hardware outputs receive from algorithms)
- Documentation includes detailed hardware configuration and Silent Way usage

### File List
**Source files:**
- `lib/core/routing/models/es5_hardware_node.dart` - ES5HardwareNode utility class

**Test files:**
- `test/core/routing/models/es5_hardware_node_test.dart` - Unit tests (27 tests, all passing)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation quality is excellent. The ES5HardwareNode class follows the established PhysicalPortGenerator pattern precisely, with clean separation of concerns and proper use of static utility methods. Code is well-documented with clear explanations of hardware configuration and Silent Way usage. All 6 acceptance criteria are fully met.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed. Code quality is already high, and no critical improvements were identified.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All standards met
  - Uses `debugPrint()` not `print()` ✓
  - Import ordering correct ✓
  - File naming follows snake_case ✓
  - Proper null safety ✓
  - Specific error types (ArgumentError) ✓
- Project Structure: ✓ Correct location and organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Appropriate unit test coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria verified

### Improvements Checklist

All items reviewed and found satisfactory:

- [x] Code follows established patterns (PhysicalPortGenerator)
- [x] Port configuration matches specifications exactly
- [x] Test coverage is excellent (27 tests, all passing)
- [x] Error handling for invalid inputs (ArgumentError for out-of-range ports)
- [x] Documentation is clear and detailed
- [x] Zero analyzer warnings verified

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This is a pure data structure utility class with no external dependencies or security-sensitive operations.

### Performance Considerations

No performance concerns. Port generation is straightforward object creation with no computational complexity. Debug logging is properly throttled using `debugPrint()`.

### Files Modified During Review

None. No code changes were required.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/ES5.002-create-es5-node-model.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done

All acceptance criteria met, excellent test coverage, zero analyzer warnings, and no blocking issues identified.
