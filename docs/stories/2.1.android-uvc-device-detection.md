# Story 2.1: UVCCamera Device Detection and Permission Handling

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story

**As a** musician using nt_helper on Android,
**I want** the app to detect my Disting NT USB camera and request proper permissions,
**so that** I can see the Disting NT display streaming on my Android device like it does on iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Device Detection**
   - App detects USB devices using `UvcCamera.getDevices()`
   - Disting NT device identified by Expert Sleepers vendor ID (0x16C0)
   - Device list returns `UsbDeviceInfo` objects with correct metadata
   - Non-UVC devices are filtered out appropriately

2. **Permission Handling**
   - Camera permission requested before USB device permission
   - USB device permission requested using `UvcCamera.requestDevicePermission()`
   - Permission denial handled gracefully with user feedback
   - Permission granted state tracked correctly

3. **Integration with Existing Code**
   - `AndroidUsbVideoChannel.listUsbCameras()` returns actual devices (not empty list)
   - `AndroidUsbVideoChannel.requestUsbPermission()` uses UVCCamera API
   - `UsbVideoManager.findDistingNT()` works correctly on Android
   - `UsbVideoManager.autoConnect()` flow works end-to-end

4. **Error Handling**
   - UVC not supported on device handled gracefully
   - Permission permanently denied scenario handled
   - Device not found errors logged appropriately
   - All exceptions caught and logged with debug messages

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree

**Primary Files:**
- `lib/services/platform_channels/android_usb_video_channel.dart` - Main implementation file (currently has mock implementation lines 26-60, 62-82, 84-97)
- `lib/services/platform_channels/usb_video_channel.dart` - Platform router (lines 26-40 show Android delegation pattern)
- `lib/domain/video/usb_video_manager.dart` - Cross-platform manager (lines 49-64 for device listing, 66-74 for findDistingNT)
- `lib/domain/video/usb_device_info.dart` - Device info model

**UVCCamera API Reference:**
```dart
// From uvccamera package (already in pubspec.yaml)
UvcCamera.isSupported() → Future<bool>
UvcCamera.getDevices() → Future<Map<String, UvcCameraDevice>>
UvcCamera.requestDevicePermission(UvcCameraDevice) → Future<bool>

// UvcCameraDevice properties
device.name → String (use as deviceId)
device.vendorId → int (check for 0x16C0)
device.productId → int
```

**Current Mock Implementation Pattern (to be replaced):**
- Lines 26-60 in `android_usb_video_channel.dart` show mock device list
- Currently returns empty list or fake devices
- Uses `UvcCamera.isSupported()` check (line 31) - keep this pattern

**Integration Pattern from iOS/macOS:**
- iOS: `ios/Runner/UsbVideoCapturePlugin.swift` lines 62-115 show AVFoundation device discovery
- macOS: `macos/Runner/UsbVideoCapturePlugin.swift` lines 54-109 show similar pattern
- Both map platform devices to `UsbDeviceInfo` format
- Android should follow same pattern using UVCCamera

**Disting NT Detection:**
- Expert Sleepers vendor ID: `0x16C0` (defined in `usb_video_manager.dart` line 26)
- `UsbDeviceInfo.isDistingNT` field set based on vendor ID match
- `UsbVideoManager.findDistingNT()` filters by this field (lines 66-74)

**Permission Flow:**
- Android requires camera permission before USB device permission
- UVCCamera example shows this pattern: camera permission → device permission → connection
- Reference: UVCCamera example `uvccamera_widget.dart` lines 182-203 from pub cache
- Pattern: check camera permission → request if needed → then request USB device permission

**Debug Logging:**
- Use `DebugService.addLocalMessage()` for debug panel visibility
- Use `debugPrint()` for console logging
- Pattern from line 21-24 in current implementation

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- Android 16KB page size compliance already handled via UVCCamera library integration (Epic prerequisite completed in v1.59.2)
- UVCCamera library is DigifinityLtd fork with 16KB compliance, already in pubspec.yaml line 89-93
- Java 17 required for Android build (already configured in `android/app/build.gradle` lines 72-78)
- EventChannel streaming pattern must be maintained for cross-platform compatibility
- Native library build workflow already in `.github/workflows/tag-build.yml` (builds UVCCamera native lib to local Maven)

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `test/services/platform_channels/android_usb_video_channel_test.dart`
- Use Mockito for mocking UVCCamera static methods
- Follow existing test pattern from `usb_video_manager_test.dart` if exists
- Test frameworks: flutter_test, mockito (already in pubspec.yaml)

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- Mock `UvcCamera.isSupported()` to return true/false
- Mock `UvcCamera.getDevices()` to return test devices with Disting NT vendor ID
- Mock `UvcCamera.requestDevicePermission()` for permission scenarios
- Test vendor ID filtering (0x16C0 detection)
- Test error scenarios: UVC not supported, permission denied, empty device list
- Verify `UsbDeviceInfo` mapping correctness (name→deviceId, vendorId, productId fields)
- Test integration with `UsbVideoManager.findDistingNT()` flow

**Manual Testing Requirements:**
- Requires physical Android device (emulator lacks USB host support)
- Requires Disting NT hardware connected via USB-C/OTG adapter
- Test permission request flow on first launch
- Test permission denial and retry
- Test device hot-plug (connect after app launch)
- Verify debug logs appear in debug panel
- Test on Android API levels 24+ (minimum supported)
