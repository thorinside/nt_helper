/// Enum representing the different types of ports in the routing system

/// In Eurorack systems, all signals are voltage-based. The distinction between
/// audio and CV is cosmetic only - it affects visualization (port colors) but
/// not connectivity or signal processing.
///
/// - audio: Displayed with warm colors (e.g., orange), typically shown as VU meters on hardware
/// - cv: Displayed with cool colors (e.g., blue), typically shown as voltage values on hardware

  /// Add mode - output is mixed with other outputs on the same bus
  add,

  /// Replace mode - output replaces any previous output on the same bus
  replace,
}

/// Enum representing the direction of a port
///
/// Deprecated: Use [PortRole] instead. PortDirection conflates signal direction
/// with hardware topology. Physical input jacks are "output" (sources) and
/// physical output jacks are "input" (sinks), which inverts the natural meaning.

/// The role a port plays in the bus-assignment routing model.
///
/// The Disting NT routing system is fundamentally bus-based:
/// - Physical jacks ARE buses (inputs = bus 1-12, outputs = bus 13-20)
/// - Algorithm parameters are assigned to bus numbers
/// - A "connection" is just a bus number shared between ports
/// - Evaluation order (slot index) determines signal flow, not port direction
@JsonEnum()
enum PortRole {
  /// Algorithm parameter that reads a value from a bus each evaluation pass.
  busReader,

  /// Algorithm parameter that writes a value to a bus each evaluation pass.
  busWriter,

  /// Physical hardware jack that IS a bus.
  /// Input jacks = bus 1-12, output jacks = bus 13-20.

  /// ES-5 expansion port that IS a bus.
  /// L = bus 29, R = bus 30, direct outputs 1-8.

/// Immutable data class representing a port in the routing system.
///
/// A port is a connection point that can send or receive signals.
/// Each port has a unique identifier, name, type, and direction.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final port = Port(
///   id: 'audio_in_1',
///   name: 'Audio Input 1',
///   type: PortType.audio,
///   direction: PortDirection.input,
/// );
