- Implement custom painting for optimal canvas performance
- Design modular widgets for maximum reusability
- Create abstract interfaces for easy testing and mocking

### Development Environment
- Run `flutter analyze` before each commit (zero tolerance policy)
- Use `debugPrint()` for all debug output
- Maintain feature branch workflow with PR reviews
- Include widget tests in continuous integration pipeline
