# Outstanding Problems

## Blocked on User Feedback

**Current Blocker**: Waiting for user to confirm if video displayed on screen in Test Attempt 3.

**Context**: 
- All code changes are complete and committed
- Logs show frames are flowing and connection is established
- User closed the widget, which triggered expected disconnect
- Unknown if video actually rendered before close

**If video displayed**: Work is complete, proceed to final verification
**If video did not display**: Need to investigate VideoFrameCubit rendering path

**Cannot proceed without this information.**
