# Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | XSS vulnerability       | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| PERF-001 | Slow query on dashboard | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Backup failure          | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
```

## 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

For each identified risk, provide mitigation:

```yaml
mitigation:
  risk_id: 'SEC-001'
  strategy: 'preventive' # preventive|detective|corrective
  actions:
    - 'Implement input validation library (e.g., validator.js)'
    - 'Add CSP headers to prevent XSS execution'
    - 'Sanitize all user inputs before storage'
    - 'Escape all outputs in templates'
  testing_requirements:
    - 'Security testing with OWASP ZAP'
    - 'Manual penetration testing of forms'
    - 'Unit tests for validation functions'
  residual_risk: 'Low - Some zero-day vulnerabilities may remain'
  owner: 'dev'
  timeline: 'Before deployment'
```

# Outputs

## Output 1: Gate YAML Block

Generate for pasting into gate file under `risk_summary`:

**Output rules:**

- Only include assessed risks; do not emit placeholders
- Sort risks by score (desc) when emitting highest and any tabular lists
- If no risks: totals all zeros, omit highest, keep recommendations arrays empty
