# Requirements: Mapping Row Highlight

**Defined:** 2026-02-01
**Core Value:** Reliable, real-time parameter control of the Disting NT via MIDI

## Milestone Requirements

### UI Highlight

- [x] **UH-01**: Parameter row or its mapping icon is visually highlighted while the mapping editor bottom sheet is open for that parameter
- [x] **UH-02**: Highlight clears automatically when the bottom sheet is dismissed

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Scroll-to-row when bottom sheet opens | Not requested, row is already visible since user tapped it |
| Highlight animation/pulse | Over-engineering for a simple indicator |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| UH-01 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| UH-02 | Phase 4 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- Milestone requirements: 2 total
- Mapped to phases: 2
- Unmapped: 0
