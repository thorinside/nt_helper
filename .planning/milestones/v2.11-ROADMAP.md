# Milestone v2.11: Mapping Row Highlight

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-01
**Phases:** 4
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

User can see at a glance which parameter row has its mapping editor open. A thin orange border appears on the mapping icon when its bottom sheet is open, and disappears when dismissed.

## Phases

### Phase 4: Mapping Row Highlight

**Goal**: User can identify which parameter row is being edited when the mapping bottom sheet is open
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of previous milestone)
**Requirements**: UH-01, UH-02
**Success Criteria:**
  1. When the mapping editor bottom sheet is open for a parameter, the corresponding row in the parameter list is visually distinguished from other rows
  2. When the bottom sheet is dismissed, no row retains highlight styling -- the list returns to its normal appearance
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Add orange highlight border to mapping icon during editing + tests

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Renamed 'widget' parameter to 'parameterViewRow' to avoid shadowing StatefulWidget's built-in 'widget' property
- Removed Builder wrapper since StatefulWidget's build method provides its own context
- Used Border.all with width 2.0 and BorderRadius.circular(20) to match the circular icon button shape

**Issues Resolved:** None

**Issues Deferred:** None

**Technical Debt Incurred:** None
