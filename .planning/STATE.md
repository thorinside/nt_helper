## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Auto-detect rather than user-selects mode (smarter detector reduces friction)
- Value analysis for byte order (more reliable than arrival order)
- Same 10-hit threshold for 14-bit (consistency with existing behavior)
- Track CC numbers, no timing window (simplified implementation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.
